## noun

A small spell or charm, often playful, petty, or mischievous rather than world-shaking (Scottish; fantasy). A **cantrip** keeps a twinkle, magic used for nicks and nudges.

> *He muttered a cantrip to dry his cuffs, the kind of magic meant for inconvenience, not destiny.*

## Etymology

From Scots **cantrip**, “a charm; a trick,” of uncertain origin. The word’s very obscurity suits its meaning: a spell too small to leave a clean paper trail.

## Related Words

- **charm** (a broader term, less specifically spell-like)
- **hex** (darker, more malicious magic)
- **incantation** (spoken spell; more solemn)
- **jape** (mischief without the supernatural)
