## preposition

Between; in the space separating two things (archaic; literary). **Betwixt** does more than locate—it lingers in the gap, evoking the uneasy, enchanted, or undecided quality of being neither here nor there.

> *He stood betwixt the house and the road, as if he could delay departure by not choosing a side.*

## adverb

In an intermediate position or state (archaic; literary).

> *The season hovered betwixt winter and spring, with thaw on the ground and frost still in the air.*

## Etymology

Old English **betwēox/betweox**, related to **two** and the idea of separation into a pair. Over time, *between* became the everyday heir, while **betwixt** kept a more atmospheric life in dialect and literature.
