## adjective

Shaped like or arranged in columns; having an upright, pillar-like form, whether in architecture, data, or the jointed geometry of certain rocks (technical; also general). **Columnar** implies both direction and structure, an upness that supports.

> *They walked through columnar basalt, the cliff face broken into dark hexagons like an organ made of stone.*

## Etymology

From Latin **columna** “pillar,” with the adjectival suffix **-ar**. The word carries the architectural sense even when applied to spreadsheets or lava—order rising in ranks.

## Related Words

- **colonnade** (a row of columns; architectural kin)
- **pillar-like** (plain descriptive equivalent)
- **stratified** (layered rather than pillar-formed)
- **basalt** (a common geological context for “columnar”)
