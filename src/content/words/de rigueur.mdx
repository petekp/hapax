## adjective

Required by the reigning code of taste, etiquette, or fashion; obligatory not by law but by social expectation (often wry). Unlike *necessary*, **de rigueur** implies a tribunal of eyes: the rule is enforced by approval and embarrassment.

> *In that circle, understatement was de rigueur; anything earnest had to be disguised as a joke.*

## Etymology

From French **de rigueur** "of strictness," from **rigueur** "strictness, severity." The phrase entered English with its irony intact: a strictness that governs trifles, and trifles that govern lives.

## Related Words

- **mandatory** (the blunt counterpart, without the social nuance)
- **fashionable** (often the effect, though not the compulsion)
- **convention** (the rulebook de rigueur points to)
- **propriety** (the moral-tinged version of the same pressure)
