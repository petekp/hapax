## noun

A short club or baton, historically a weapon and later a tool of policing; authority made hand-held (historical; also modern). Unlike a *sword*, which is edged and ceremonial, a **truncheon** is blunt: force without flourish.

> *The truncheon hung at his belt like a sentence waiting to be spoken.*

## Etymology

From Old French forms related to **tronc** “trunk,” from Latin **truncus**. The idea is literal: a shortened piece of wood—trunk made portable.
