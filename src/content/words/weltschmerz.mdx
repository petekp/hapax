## noun

“World-pain”: a melancholy arising from the perceived gap between how the world is and how it ought to be—sorrow with a philosophical horizon (literary; German loanword). Unlike *depression*, which is clinical, **weltschmerz** is interpretive: grief as an opinion about reality.

> *His weltschmerz wasn’t self-pity; it was pity for a world that kept failing its own possibilities.*

## Etymology

From German **Welt** “world” + **Schmerz** “pain.” Popularized in Romantic-era discourse, where sensitivity itself could feel like a wound.

- **ennui** (weariness; smaller, more private)
- **melancholy** (broader and older term)
- **oughtness** (the moral pressure whose frustration can produce weltschmerz)
