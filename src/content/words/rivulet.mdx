## noun

A small stream, a slender run of water that threads through a larger landscape, often more whisper than roar. A **rivulet** emphasizes thinness and motion, a line of water drawn quickly across the earth.

> *A rivulet ran along the gutter after the storm, carrying leaves like little boats with nowhere to dock.*

## Etymology

From French **rivulet**, diminutive of **riviere** "river," ultimately from Latin **rivus** "stream." The suffix makes the water small enough to seem intimate.

- **rill** (an even smaller stream; often in hillsides)
