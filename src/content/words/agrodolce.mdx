## adjective

Having the sweet-and-sour balance prized in Italian cookery: vinegar's bite tempered by sugar, honey, fruit, or reduced must. Where generic *sweet-and-sour* can be clumsy, **agrodolce** is deliberately tuned, sharpness and sweetness held in the same mouthful.

> *The onions came glossy with agrodolce—sugar just singing, vinegar keeping the note honest.*

## noun

A preparation or sauce built on that balance, often served with vegetables, fish, or meat (culinary).

> *She spooned a little agrodolce over the sardines, and the whole plate brightened into summer.*

## Etymology

A borrowing from Italian **agrodolce**, literally "sour-sweet," from **agro** "sour, sharp" + **dolce** "sweet." The word holds its own recipe in its syllables: abrasion and comfort, married.
