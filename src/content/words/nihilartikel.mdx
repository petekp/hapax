A deliberately fictitious entry planted in a reference work. Dictionaries, encyclopedias, and directories sometimes include these false entries as copyright traps or tests of reader attentiveness. A **nihilartikel** is "nothing" dressed as knowledge, intentional rather than accidental.

> *The scholar smiled when she met the nihilartikel—an invented biography tucked in among the real ones like a watermark made of words.*

## Etymology

From German **Nihilartikel**, a compound of Latin **nihil** "nothing" and German **Artikel** "article." Bluntly elegant: an "article about nothing," inserted so that copying can be proved or readers tested for attentiveness.
