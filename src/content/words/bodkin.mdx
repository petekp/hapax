## noun

A small, pointed implement—especially a thick needle or awl for piercing cloth or leather, or a long pin for fastening hair; in older use, also a slender dagger (historical). **Bodkin** suggests compact sharpness: a tool meant to slip through.

> *She secured the twist of her hair with a bodkin, the metal disappearing like a secret kept in plain sight.*

## Etymology

Middle English **bodkin**, long used for pointed tools and, in some contexts, a small dagger. The exact formation is uncertain, though the diminutive ending **-kin** fits the sense: a “little piercer,” practical enough to live in a sewing kit and sharp enough to turn metaphorical in literature.
