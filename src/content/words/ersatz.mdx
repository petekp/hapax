## adjective

Substitute, often with an undertone of inferiority or make-do pragmatism. A replacement that mimics the original but cannot quite inherit its value. Serviceable, but telling.

> *The hotel served ersatz maple syrup—sweet enough, but without the forest in it.*

## noun

A substitute product or imitation.

> *He drank the ersatz cheer of the party and felt thirstier afterward.*

## Etymology

Borrowed from German **Ersatz** “replacement,” from **ersetzen** “to replace.” The word entered English with the historical taste of scarcity—times when substitutes were necessary, and their shortcomings impossible to ignore.

## Related Words

- **substitute** (neutral term; lacks the judgment)
- **facsimile** (copy; can be faithful without being ersatz)
- **imitation** (broad, sometimes pejorative)
