## noun

A figure of speech that affirms by denying the opposite—an understatement that gains force by restraint (rhetoric). Unlike mere modesty, **litotes** is calculated: it lets the listener supply the stronger claim, and that participation sharpens it.

> *“Not unfamiliar,” she said with a smile—litotes doing what a direct confession could not.*

## Etymology

From Greek **litotēs** “plainness, simplicity,” from **litos** “plain.” The figure’s power lies in its refusal to overstate: plainness as a kind of precision.

## Related Words

- **understatement** (the broader strategy litotes exemplifies)
- **meiosis** (a related rhetorical downplaying)
- **irony** (often a fellow traveler, though not required)
- **hyperbole** (the opposite impulse: overstatement)
