Feign or exaggerate illness to avoid duty, labor, or obligation. **Malinger** implies deceit, time stolen under the disguise of weakness.

> *He wasn’t sick enough to stay home, but he malingered anyway, letting the day disappear behind drawn curtains.*

## Etymology

From French **malingre** “sickly,” likely from **mal** “bad” + a Germanic element meaning “thin, weak.” English turned an adjective for frailty into a verb for pretense: weakness repurposed as strategy.

## Related Words

- **shirk** (avoid duty; broader and less medical)
- **feign** (pretend; the general mechanism)
- **hypochondria** (health anxiety; different motive, often misapplied)
- **skive** (informal “avoid work”; cultural cousin)
