## adjective

Self-styled, calling itself so, often with implied skepticism about the claim. **Soi-disant** carries a sharper eyebrow than "so-called": the title is asserted by the subject, not granted by consensus.

> *The soi-disant expert spoke with great certainty, and the room quietly checked its own notes.*

## Etymology

Borrowed from French **soi-disant** “self-saying,” from **soi** “oneself” + **disant** “saying.” English kept it for moments when doubt wants to sound elegant.

## Related Words

- **self-proclaimed** (a plain equivalent)
- **pretended** (harsher; implies falsity outright)
- **putative** (supposed; more neutral and legal-toned)
- **nominal** (in name only; adjacent in effect)
