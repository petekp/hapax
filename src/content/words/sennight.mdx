## noun

A period of seven days, reckoned as seven nights. A week named by darkness rather than daylight. **Sennight** feels calendrical and old, time measured in nights huddled together.

> *He would return in a sennight, he said, and the promise sounded like something written in oak and ink.*

## Etymology

From Old English **seofon niht** "seven nights," later contracted. Like *fortnight*, it preserves a habit of counting by nights, an older arithmetic, winter-minded and practical.

## Related Words

- **fortnight** (two-week span; the most familiar kin)
- **week** (the modern standard term)
- **ychthemeron** (a learned “day-and-night” unit; far more technical)
- **bygone** (often the atmosphere that sennight evokes)
