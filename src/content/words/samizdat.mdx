## noun

Clandestine, self-published writing circulated outside state censorship, especially in the former Soviet sphere; literature as a network of hands and risk (historical; political). Unlike ordinary *publishing*, **samizdat** is defined by its conditions: secrecy, copying, and the courage of distribution.

> *The poems traveled as samizdat—typed, retyped, and passed on like contraband hope.*

## Etymology

From Russian **самиздат (samizdat)**, literally “self-publishing,” modeled on official Soviet publishing labels: **sam** “self” + **izdat** (from **izdatel’stvo**, “publishing house”). The irony is sharp: bureaucracy’s format repurposed for disobedience.

## Related Words

- **underground press** (a broader analogue in other contexts)
- **censorship** (the pressure that makes samizdat necessary)
- **dissident** (a frequent human engine of samizdat networks)
- **samizdatny** (pertaining to samizdat; rarer adjectival form)
