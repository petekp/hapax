## noun

A word or expression attested only once within a given corpus, author, or language record. Singular in the surviving evidence, and therefore fragile in interpretation. Where a *rare word* has company, a **hapax legomenon** is lonely by definition: its meaning must be inferred without siblings.

> *The translator paused over the hapax legomenon, feeling the whole poem hinge on a word that appeared nowhere else to explain itself.*

## Etymology

From Greek **hapax** "once" + **legomenon** "(something) said," from **legein** "to say." The phrase is scholarship's way of naming a particular kind of silence: the archive speaking only once, then refusing repetition.

## Related Words

- **nonce word** (coined for a single occasion; not necessarily a hapax in the record)
- **legomenon** (the "thing said," the second half of the term)
- **philology** (the discipline that worries hapax words into sense)
- **attestation** (the evidentiary heartbeat of the concept)
