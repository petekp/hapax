## noun

An abrupt descent from the lofty to the trivial, producing a comic or embarrassing anticlimax. Often happens when grandeur is pursued too hard and collapses under its own seriousness. Where *pathos* stirs genuine feeling, **bathos** spoils emotion through misjudged elevation.

> *The elegy soared until it compared grief to a broken smartphone, and bathos did the rest.*

## Etymology

From Greek **bathos** “depth.” In English the term is famously sharpened by Alexander Pope’s satirical treatise *Peri Bathous* (1727), which mocked the art of sinking in poetry. “Depth,” in the joke, becomes a plunge.

## Related Words

- **anticlimax** (the structural effect bathos often produces)
- **pathos** (the earnest emotional register bathos can inadvertently sabotage)
- **burlesque** (comic lowering, sometimes intentional rather than accidental)
- **sentimentality** (a frequent doorway into bathos)
