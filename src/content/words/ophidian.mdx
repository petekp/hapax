## adjective

Snake-like; serpentine in form, motion, or suggestion. **Ophidian** carries the animal in it, sleekness with an undertone of instinct and unease.

> *An ophidian shadow slid through the grass, and the birds adjusted their songs without stopping them.*

## noun

A snake; any member of the serpent kind (technical; rare in general prose).

> *The field guide distinguished each ophidian by scale and eye, as if naming could make fear orderly.*

## Etymology

From Greek **ophis** “snake,” through Latinized scientific usage. The root is ancient and blunt; the adjective is a later polish on old dread and fascination.
