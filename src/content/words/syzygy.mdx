An alignment of celestial bodies, especially three in a line, as in sun, moon, and earth at eclipse. Also, more broadly, a paired conjunction or yoked set. **Syzygy** is geometry: alignment as event.

> *The eclipse was a brief syzygy, a neat line drawn across the immense disorder of space.*

## Etymology
