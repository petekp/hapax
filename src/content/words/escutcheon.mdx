## noun

1. A shield bearing heraldic arms; by extension, the surface on which such arms are displayed (heraldry).

> *Above the hearth the escutcheon gleamed faintly, a family’s story reduced to color, line, and animal.*

2. A protective or ornamental plate surrounding a keyhole, door handle, light switch, or similar fitting (technical).

## Etymology

From Old French **escuchon** “shield,” a diminutive of **escu** “shield,” from Latin **scūtum**. The word’s journey is from battlefield to blueprint: a shield first for bodies, then for names, then for hardware.
