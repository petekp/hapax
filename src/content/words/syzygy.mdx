## noun

An alignment of celestial bodies—especially three in a line, as in sun–moon–earth at eclipse; also, more broadly, a paired conjunction or yoked set (astronomy; technical; also literary). Unlike *coincidence*, **syzygy** is geometry: alignment as event.

> *The eclipse was a brief syzygy, a neat line drawn across the immense disorder of space.*

## Etymology

From Greek **syzygia** “yoking together,” from **syn-** “together” + **zygon** “yoke.” The word keeps the ancient agricultural image for cosmic arrangement.

## Related Words

- **eclipse** (a phenomenon produced by syzygy)
- **conjunction** (general astronomical alignment)
- **hemiola** (a different kind of alignment—of beats)
- **quincunx** (patterned placement; kin in geometry)
