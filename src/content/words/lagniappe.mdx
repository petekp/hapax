## noun

A small, unexpected extra given as a bonus—an added gift beyond what was purchased or promised (regional U.S., especially Gulf Coast). Unlike a *discount*, **lagniappe** is generosity in kind: something tangible slipped in with a wink.

> *The baker handed her the loaf and, with it, a lagniappe of warm rolls—“for the walk home,” he said.*

## Etymology

From Louisiana French **lagniappe**, traced through Spanish American **la ñapa** “the gift” or “extra,” ultimately from Quechua **yapa** “added.” The word is a little history of exchange: Indigenous, Spanish, French, and English layers gathered into one sweet custom.

## Related Words

- **bonus** (the generic equivalent)
- **gratuity** (a gift or tip; often more formalized)
- **perquisite** (an extra benefit; more institutional)
