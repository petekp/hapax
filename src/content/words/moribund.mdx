## adjective

Near death; also, sinking into terminal decline, still present but no longer renewing itself. **Moribund** keeps a faint pulse. The thing endures, but only by inertia.

> *The moribund factory kept one light on at night, as if pretending production might resume.*

## Etymology

From Latin **moribundus** “about to die,” from **mori** “to die.” The word’s tone is clinical, but its implication is humane: an ending in progress.

- **ossified** (hardened, rigid; a common stage before moribundity)
- **defunct** (no longer functioning; more final)
- **waning** (diminishing; gentler in register)
