## noun

A miscellaneous jumble; a hodgepodge in which disparate elements are thrown together without clear order—often with a faintly comic or culinary undertone (literary). Unlike a neutral *mixture*, **gallimaufry** suggests a chaotic stew: many ingredients, no single recipe.

> *The speech was a gallimaufry of slogans, anecdotes, and half-remembered statistics, simmered into noise.*

## Etymology

From French **galimafrée**, originally a kind of ragout or stew. The word’s metaphor is built-in: disorder as cookery—leftovers made into something that fills the pot, if not the palate.
