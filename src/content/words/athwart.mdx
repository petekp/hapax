## preposition

Across; from side to side of; lying or cutting through at an angle. **Athwart** carries a sense of crossing that interrupts—an obstacle, a bar, a line set against easy passage.

> *A fallen pine lay athwart the trail, forcing the hikers into the wet weeds at its edges.*

## adverb

Crosswise; in opposition; so as to thwart or impede (literary).

> *Their plans ran smooth until one small fear came athwart them and everything began to snag.*

## Etymology

From Middle English forms meaning “across,” built from **a-** “on, in” + **thwart**, from Old Norse **þvert** “across.” The word still feels like its own meaning: a hard consonantal plank laid over the road.
