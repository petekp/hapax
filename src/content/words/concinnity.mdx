Elegant harmony of arrangement, parts fitted to one another with such aptness that the whole seems inevitable (literary; rhetorical). **Concinnity** implies a felt rightness, proportion made persuasive.

> *The essay’s concinnity was what moved her most—every sentence placed as if it had always belonged there.*

## Etymology

From Latin **concinnitās** “skillful arrangement, harmony,” from **concinnus** “neat, well put together.” The word has always been about craft: beauty not as accident, but as exact fitting.
