## verb

Soften in temper or feeling; calm by gentle persuasion or conciliatory action; also, soften in physical texture (formal). Unlike *appease*, which can imply mere pacification, **mollify** suggests a real change in hardness—anger loosening, resistance yielding.

> *A sincere apology mollified her, not because it erased the harm, but because it admitted it without defense.*

## Etymology

From Latin **mollificare** “to make soft,” from **mollis** “soft” + **facere** “to make.” The word is tactile at its root, and that tactility survives in its emotional sense.

## Related Words

- **placate** (to calm; often more strategic)
- **assuage** (to ease; frequently of pain or fear)
- **mitigate** (to lessen severity; more procedural)
