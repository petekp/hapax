## noun

In a church choir stall, a small ledge on the underside of a folding seat, allowing a person to rest discreetly while nominally standing. Mercy engineered into wood. A **misericord** is hidden help, comfort granted without breaking posture.

> *During the long psalm, he leaned onto the misericord, grateful for a mercy that asked no acknowledgment.*

## Etymology

From Medieval Latin **misericordia** “mercy,” from **misereri** “to pity” + **cor** “heart.” The term names a practical kindness: compassion translated into carpentry.
