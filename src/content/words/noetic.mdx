## adjective

Of the mind or intellect; pertaining to inner understanding, especially as grasped by thought rather than sense. **Noetic** points toward cognition's finest grain, knowing as an inward act.

> *His noetic life was rich—quiet, private, and always assembling meaning from small observations.*

## Etymology

From Greek **noētikos** “intellectual,” from **nous** “mind.” The word entered English as philosophy’s tool for distinguishing what is thought from what is merely felt or seen.
