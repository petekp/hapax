Quibble or haggle over petty details, especially in a legalistic way; to obscure substance with trivia. **Pettifogging** is precision weaponized, small points used to stall or win.

> *He pettifogged over commas and definitions until the meeting forgot what problem it had come to solve.*

## noun

Petty, caviling argumentation; small-minded legal maneuvering (rare).

> *The case should have been simple, but it drowned in pettifog and procedural spite.*

## Etymology

From early modern English, combining **petty** with an element suggesting "fog" in the sense of muddling or chaff. The word itself is a sneer, making the act sound small and dirty.
