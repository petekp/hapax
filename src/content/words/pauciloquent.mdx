## adjective

Using few words; sparing in speech, often with an air of deliberate restraint. **Pauciloquent** can be purely economical where *taciturn* sometimes implies moodiness. Silence as style.

> *He was pauciloquent at dinner, but when he spoke the sentence arrived finished, like a stone placed exactly.*

## Etymology

From Latin **pauci-** “few” + **loquens** “speaking,” from **loqui** “to speak.” A Latinate precision for a human habit: brevity made a trait.

## Related Words

- **taciturn** (quiet, often temperamentally so)
- **laconic** (brief to the point of sharpness)
- **reticent** (reserved; sometimes misunderstood as merely “quiet”)
- **terseness** (the noun-state of the quality)
