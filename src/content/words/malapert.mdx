## adjective

Boldly impudent; saucily forward in a way that presumes permission it has not been given. Where rudeness can be blunt, **malapert** has a pert cheekiness to it, insolence with a smirk.

> *The apprentice offered a malapert remark and was met with a silence sharp enough to correct him.*

## Etymology

From Old French **mal apert** “ill-suited; ill-bred,” literally “badly open” (**mal** “badly” + **apert** “open, frank”). What begins as “too open” becomes, in social life, “too bold.”
