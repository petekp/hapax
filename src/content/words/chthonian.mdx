Of the underworld or the depths of the earth; earthy in the sense of subterranean, primeval, and uncanny (literary; mythological). **Chthonian** implies ancient powers below the surface, fertility and dread braided together.

> *The cave air had a chthonian chill, as though daylight were only a rumor told above.*

## Etymology

From Greek **khthṓn** “earth” (especially the earth as the world below), yielding **khthónios** “of the underworld.” In English the term keeps its mythic gravity: earth not as soil for gardens, but as the realm that swallows and remembers.

## Related Words

- **cthonic** (variant spelling)
- **infernal** (of hell; nearby but more moralized)
- **telluric** (of the earth; more scientific, less mythic)
- **nether** (poetic “below,” often paired in mood)
