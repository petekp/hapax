## noun

The body’s sense of itself in space: the unconscious awareness of limb position, movement, and balance that lets you touch your nose with eyes closed or walk without watching your feet (physiology). Unlike *touch*, which meets the world, **proprioception** is inward—perception of the self by the self.

> *In the dark she reached for the banister, trusting proprioception to place her hand where memory said wood would be.*

## Etymology

Built from Latin **proprius** “one’s own” + **perception**. The coinage names a subtle faculty long taken for granted: that the body is not only moved, but also quietly *known*.

## Related Words

- **kinesthesia** (sense of movement; often overlapping)
- **vestibular** (balance system; a key contributor)
- **sensorimotor** (the loop between sensing and acting)
- **somatic** (of the body; the broader domain)
