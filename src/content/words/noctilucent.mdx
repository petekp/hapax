## adjective

Shining at night; luminous in darkness. Especially of clouds that glow after sunset with a cold, high-altitude light. **Noctilucent** names the circumstance rather than the mechanism: light that belongs to night.

> *Above the darkened city, noctilucent clouds hung like pale brushstrokes the sun had not quite let go.*

## Etymology

From Latin **nocti-** "night" + **lucent-** "shining," from **lucēre** "to shine." A small astronomy lesson in two syllables: night, too, can have its radiance.
