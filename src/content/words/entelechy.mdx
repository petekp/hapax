## noun

In Aristotelian philosophy, realized being. The state in which a thing's potential is fully actualized, its end (*telos*) present as a living completeness. The fulfillment is inward, form completed from within.

> *He spoke of character as entelechy—what a life becomes when it finally matches its own deepest pattern.*

## Etymology

From Greek **entelecheia**, traditionally analyzed as **en** “in” + **telos** “end, purpose” + a formative element suggesting “having” or “being in a certain state.” The term was coined to name a subtle idea: purpose not as a future aim, but as an active principle already at work.
