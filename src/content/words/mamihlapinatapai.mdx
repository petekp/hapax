## noun

A shared look between two people, each wishing the other would initiate something both desire, while each hesitates to be the first. **Mamihlapinatapai** names a whole social stalemate, with desire, shyness, and mutual permission suspended in the eyes.

> *Their conversation stalled, but the room was still full of mamihlapinatapai—two smiles waiting for one brave sentence.*

## Etymology

From Yaghan (Yámana), an Indigenous language of Tierra del Fuego. The word has become famous in English-speaking circles for its specificity, though its notoriety sometimes flattens its origin into a curiosity. Treated properly, it is evidence of what languages do best: give crisp form to a human moment that otherwise evaporates.

## Related Words

- **hesitation** (the psychological mechanism behind the look)
- **limerence** (a state in which such charged moments often occur)
- **taciturn** (silence as habit; not the same, but adjacent in effect)
- **subtext** (the unsaid meaning such a look carries)
