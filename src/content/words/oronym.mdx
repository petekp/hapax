## noun

A sequence of words that sounds identical (or nearly so) to a different sequence, creating ambiguity by the ear. *Ice cream* and *I scream*, *a nice cold hour* and *an ice-cold hour*. An **oronym** may be accidental where a *pun* is deliberate, meaning split by sound alone.

> *The child heard “four candles” as “fork handles,” and the oronym turned the request into a small, perfect comedy.*

## Etymology

A modern linguistic formation built from Greek **oron-** "boundary, limit" (as in *horizon*) + **-onym** "name, word." A boundary in speech: where one listener's word-break becomes another's.
