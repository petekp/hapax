## noun

A painting or decorative scheme executed chiefly in shades of gray (and sometimes muted browns), often to imitate sculpture or to underpaint a work that will later bloom into color (art). Unlike simple *monochrome*, **grisaille** implies intention: austerity used as illusion or foundation.

> *In grisaille the saints looked carved rather than painted, as if color had been withheld to make devotion harder and truer.*

## Etymology

From French **gris** “gray,” with a suffix suggesting a style or manner. The term belongs to workshops and chapels—places where restraint can be a kind of spectacle.
