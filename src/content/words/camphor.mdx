A strong-smelling, waxy, volatile substance, cool to the touch and sharp to the nose, used in medicine, incense, and preservation. Now often produced synthetically as well as derived from certain trees (technical; also common). **Camphor** is bracing, medicinal, almost admonitory.

> *When she opened the old trunk, the camphor rose first—clean, stern, and unmistakably grandmotherly.*

## Etymology

Through medieval Latin and French from Arabic **kāfūr**, ultimately from Sanskrit **karpūra**, reflecting the long trade routes by which aromatic resins traveled. The word, like the substance, has moved easily through borders. Pungent enough to announce itself in any language.

- **incense** (the ritual context camphor often inhabits)
