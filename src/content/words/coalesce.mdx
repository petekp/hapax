## verb

Come together into a single whole—particles, people, ideas, or factions merging until the seam is hard to find (formal). Unlike *gather*, which can remain a crowd, **coalesce** implies fusion: many becoming one.

> *By midnight the scattered complaints had coalesced into a plan, and the room felt suddenly purposeful.*

## Etymology

From Latin **coalescere** “to grow together,” from **co-** “together” + **alescere** “to grow” (inchoative of **alere** “to nourish”). The word’s core metaphor is organic: union as a kind of shared growth.

## Related Words

- **congeal** (to thicken into unity; often of liquids or feelings)
- **consolidate** (to make firm; more deliberate and procedural)
- **accrete** (to grow by gradual addition; slower than coalescence)
- **amalgamate** (to merge into a uniform mass)
