## noun

A sequence of words that sounds identical (or nearly so) to a different sequence, creating ambiguity by the ear: *ice cream* and *I scream*, *a nice cold hour* and *an ice-cold hour* (linguistics). Unlike a *pun*, which is often deliberate, an **oronym** may be accidental—meaning split by sound alone.

> *The child heard “four candles” as “fork handles,” and the oronym turned the request into a small, perfect comedy.*

## Etymology

A modern linguistic formation built from Greek **oron-** “boundary, limit” (as in *horizon*) + **-onym** “name, word.” The idea is a boundary in speech: where one listener’s word-break becomes another’s.
