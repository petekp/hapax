1. The deliberate repetition of a word or phrase at the beginnings of successive clauses or lines, creating insistence and rhythm, a mounting emotional charge.

> *In her speech the anaphora did the heavy lifting—“We will rebuild, we will return, we will remember”—until the hall began to breathe with her.*

2. In grammar and linguistics, the use of a word (often a pronoun) that points back to an earlier referent. Backward reference as a method of cohesion.

> *The sentence is held together by anaphora: “When the storm arrived, **it** arrived all at once.”*

## Etymology

From Greek **anaphorá** "a carrying back," from **ana-** "back" + **pherein** "to carry." The metaphor is exact. The repeated phrase returns like a tide; the pronoun reaches back like a hand.
