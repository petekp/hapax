A figure of speech that affirms by denying the opposite, an understatement that gains force by restraint (rhetoric). Calculated rather than merely modest. It lets the listener supply the stronger claim, and that participation sharpens it.

> *“Not unfamiliar,” she said with a smile—litotes doing what a direct confession could not.*
