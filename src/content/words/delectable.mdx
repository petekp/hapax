## adjective

Delightful to taste or sense, pleasing with a savoring kind of pleasure. You enjoy something delectable slowly because it rewards attention. The word suggests relish and discernment, a pleasure that invites lingering.

> *The peaches were delectable—soft as sighs, sweet without cloying, and gone too soon.*

## Etymology

From Middle English via Old French, ultimately from Latin **delectare** “to delight.” The root carries a gentle insistence: pleasure not seized, but invited and prolonged.
