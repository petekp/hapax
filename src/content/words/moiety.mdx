## noun

One of two equal parts; a half—especially in legal, formal, or technical division (formal). Unlike *half*, which is common and blunt, **moiety** implies partition as concept: division recognized and named.

> *By the treaty each side claimed a moiety of the land, as if geography could be halved by ink.*

## Etymology

From Old French **moitié** “half,” from Latin **medietas** “middle-ness,” from **medius** “middle.” The word’s history reveals an older sense: half as what lies midway, a portion defined by relationship.

## Related Words

- **half** (the everyday equivalent)
- **portion** (a part; less strictly “one of two equal parts”)
- **equitable** (fair division; often the aim behind moiety)
- **medial** (middle; sharing Latin ancestry)
