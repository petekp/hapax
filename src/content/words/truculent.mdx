## adjective

Aggressively defiant, eager to fight, or at least to bare teeth at the world. **Truculent** is outward-facing, hostility as stance.

> *The dog’s truculent posture was mostly noise, but the noise was persuasive.*

## Etymology

From Latin **truculentus** “savage, fierce,” related to **trux** “grim.” The word carries a hard, bristling mouthfeel: consonants like clenched jaw.

- **bellicose** (warlike; often more political)
- **mordicant** (biting in speech; truculence of tongue)
- **intransigent** (unyielding; truculence without the snarl)
