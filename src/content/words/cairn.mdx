A heap of stones deliberately piled as a marker of a trail, a summit, a boundary, a grave, a memory. A **cairn** is modest and communal; any passerby may add a stone and thus renew the sign.

> *On the ridge the fog erased the path, but the cairn held steady, a small human answer to blank weather.*

## Etymology

From Scottish Gaelic **càrn** “heap of stones.” The word carries the landscape that made it necessary: places where wood rots, metal rusts, and only stone can be trusted to remain.

## Related Words

- **waymark** (the function a cairn often serves)
- **dolmen** (a different megalithic form, more architectural)
