## noun

A tiny spark, the smallest perceptible trace of a quality: hope, doubt, wit, light. Barely there, yet enough to change the reading of a whole moment. A **scintilla** is vivid, a pinprick of brightness.

> *There was a scintilla of mercy in his refusal, just enough to keep anger from hardening into hate.*

## Etymology

From Latin **scintilla** “spark,” related to verbs meaning “to flash.” English keeps the word for when “spark” feels too plain and one wants the Latin’s crisp, bright delicacy.

## Related Words

- **spark** (common synonym)
- **glimmer** (a faint light; often more sustained than a scintilla)
- **coruscation** (flashing brightness; a larger, livelier cousin)
- **iota** (a tiny amount; quantity without the spark-image)
