## adjective

1. Remarkably beautiful or finely wrought; possessing a precision that feels almost impossibly exact (literary; also general).

> *The miniature was exquisite—so detailed you could almost hear the painted figures whispering.*

2. Keenly sensitive, especially to pleasure or pain; finely tuned to slight impressions (formal).

> *After the fever broke, she had an exquisite awareness of light, as if the world had been newly lacquered.*

## noun

## Etymology

From Latin **exquisitus** “carefully sought out,” past participle of **exquirere** “to search out.” What is exquisite, the word suggests, has been chosen with effort—beauty as selection, not accident.
