## noun

An awkward mishap in the flow of social life; an inopportune incident that derails proceedings not by catastrophe but by ill timing (often wry). Unlike *disaster*, a **contretemps** is small enough to survive—large enough to be remembered.

> *The toast began tenderly, then a phone rang in the sudden hush—a perfect contretemps, and everyone laughed a little too hard.*

## Etymology

Borrowed from French **contretemps**, literally “counter-time” (**contre** “against” + **temps** “time”). What goes wrong, the word suggests, is not merely what happens but *when*—events arriving out of turn, like a footfall on the wrong beat.

## Related Words

- **faux pas** (a misstep of manners; often a kind of contretemps)
- **misadventure** (broader, with more narrative weight)
- **anticlimax** (a structural sag that a contretemps can produce)
- **inopportune** (the timing that defines it)
