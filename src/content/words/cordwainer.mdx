A maker of shoes from new leather; traditionally distinguished from the cobbler, who repairs what is already worn (historical). **Cordwainer** carries the dignity of craft: not mending the foot’s history, but building its future.

> *The cordwainer’s bench smelled of hide and beeswax, and each pair began as a promise made to a last.*

## Etymology

From Middle English, via Anglo-French, ultimately tied to **Cordovan** leather—fine goatskin associated with Córdoba in Spain. The word keeps an old trade-route embedded in it: city to leather to shoe to name.
