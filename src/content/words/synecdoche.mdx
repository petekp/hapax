## noun

A figure of speech in which a part stands for the whole, the whole for a part, the species for the genus, or the material for the thing. Meaning traded through a precise substitution. Where *metaphor* shifts by resemblance, **synecdoche** shifts by belonging.

> *“All hands on deck,” he said—synecdoche turning bodies into labor by naming the part that works.*

## Etymology

From Greek **synekdoche** "understanding one thing with another," from **syn-** "together" + **ekdechesthai** "to take up." A kind of mental bookkeeping.

## Related Words

- **metonymy** (association rather than part–whole)
- **pars pro toto** (Latin label for part-for-whole)
- **zeugma** (another figure of linkage and strain)
- **catachresis** (misapplied term; synecdoche done wrong can become it)
