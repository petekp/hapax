The sky conceived as a vast dome or vault overhead, once imagined as a solid sphere holding the stars, now used poetically for the visible heavens. Where *sky* is simply there, **firmament** carries cosmology, the sense of an ordered architecture above.

> *The storm cleared, and the firmament returned, hard with stars, as if night had been hammered into place.*

## Etymology

From Latin **firmāmentum** “a support,” from **firmus** “firm.” The word entered English through biblical and medieval cosmological language, where the heavens were imagined as structure, not emptiness: something that could “hold.”
