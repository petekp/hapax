A ridge or mound of rock and earth carried and then left behind by a glacier, its debris made legible as landscape. A **moraine** is a record of motion, stone deposited by ice's slow insistence.

> *Beyond the meltwater lake, a moraine rose like a rough shoreline—the glacier’s handwriting after it had gone.*

## Etymology

From French **moraine**, a regional Alpine word for glacial debris. The term traveled with the science that learned to read valleys as histories of ice: heaps of stone reinterpreted as evidence, not accident.

## Related Words

- **till** (unsorted glacial sediment; often what moraines are made of)
- **drumlin** (another glacial landform, smoother and more streamlined)
- **cirque** (a bowl-shaped hollow carved by glaciers)
- **outwash** (sediment carried away by meltwater, beyond the ice)
