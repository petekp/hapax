A deep, wistful longing for something absent: someone, a time, a home, a feeling. Tinged with sweetness as well as sorrow. **Saudade** is emotionally layered: the ache is part of the treasure, because it proves what mattered.

> *When the song ended, saudade lingered in the room like perfume after an embrace.*

## Etymology

Borrowed from Portuguese **saudade**, central to Lusophone music and literature, especially the expressive world of fado. Its roots reach back into medieval Iberian language, but its cultural life is ongoing. A way of holding absence with dignity.
