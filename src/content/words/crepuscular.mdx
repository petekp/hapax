Of twilight; active or occurring chiefly at dawn and dusk, when the world is neither day nor night and edges soften into uncertainty (scientific; also literary). **Crepuscular** belongs to thresholds, the hour when light hesitates.

> *Coyotes are crepuscular; you hear them most when the sky is still deciding what it will be.*

## Etymology

From Latin **crepusculum** “twilight,” a diminutive suggesting a smaller, gentler dark. The word carries the feeling of that time: not blackness, but a dimming that makes familiar things strange.
