## noun

Studied nonchalance, effortless grace achieved by careful practice and then artfully concealed. **Sprezzatura** is ease as performance: the labor is real, but its traces are intentionally erased.

> *Her sprezzatura was flawless—every remark tossed off as if improvised, though you could feel the rehearsed precision beneath it.*

## Etymology

From Italian **sprezzatura**, popularized by Baldassare Castiglione in *Il Cortegiano* (The Book of the Courtier), describing the ideal courtly manner: to do difficult things "without effort." The concept outlived courts because it names a durable temptation, wanting skill without seeming to have sweated for it.
