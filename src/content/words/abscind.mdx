## verb

Cut away with clean finality; sever by decisive removal (formal, rare). Unlike *trim* or *prune*, **abscind** implies not shaping but separating—making a boundary where once there was continuity.

> *With one motion the surgeon abscinded the dead tissue, leaving a sharp edge that could begin again.*

## Etymology

From Latin **abscindere** “to cut off,” from **ab-** “away” + **scindere** “to split, cleave.” In English it has long carried an air of the scalpel and the statute: a learned verb for acts that cannot be undone.

## Related Words

- **excise** (cut out, often officially or surgically)
- **scission** (a splitting; division)
- **ablation** (removal, especially of material or tissue)
- **sever** (the plain-voiced near-synonym)
