Disuse through long neglect. A law, custom, word, or ritual falls into desuetude when it is left behind until it no longer governs and is barely remembered. The abandonment is quiet, a fading out rather than a replacement.

> *The ordinance remained on the books, but in desuetude—ignored so completely it had become a legal ghost.*

## Etymology

From Latin **dēsūētūdō** “unaccustomedness,” from **de-** “away from” + **suēscere** “to become accustomed” (related to **suētus** “accustomed”). What falls into desuetude is not defeated; it is simply no longer practiced, and practice is how rules stay alive.

- **atavism** (a reappearance from the past—what desuetude sometimes hides)
- **archaic** (a label for what desuetude can produce)
- **moribund** (dying; often said of institutions or practices)
