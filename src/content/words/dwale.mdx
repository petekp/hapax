Deadly nightshade, or a soporific potion once associated with it. By extension, a stupefying sleep or torpor. The drowsiness here carries danger, a drifting that may not return.

> *The old ballad warned of dwale in the cup: sweetness first, then a silence too deep to wake from.*

## Etymology

From Middle English **dwale**, a northern word tied to older Germanic forms for stupor and delirium. It moved easily between plant and potion, because in folklore the boundary between herb and spell was always thin.

## Related Words

- **belladonna** (the plant most often meant by “deadly nightshade”)
- **soporific** (sleep-inducing; clinical counterpart)
- **nard** (another historically narcotic aromatic, though less lethal)
- **lethe** (mythic forgetfulness; a poetic cousin)
