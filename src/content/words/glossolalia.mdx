Speech that resembles language without being intelligible as such. Often occurring in religious ecstasy as "speaking in tongues," where sound carries fervor beyond semantic sense. Where *babble* is meaningless, **glossolalia** implies meaning sought through utterance itself: voice reaching for the unsayable.

> *The hymn ended, and a tide of glossolalia rose in the sanctuary, syllables like sparks, faith finding its own grammar.*

## Etymology

From Greek **glōssa** “tongue, language” + **lalia** “talking, speech.” Coined in learned discourse, the term gives clinical outline to an experience that participants often describe as anything but clinical.

- **ecstasy** (the altered state in which glossolalia is frequently reported)
