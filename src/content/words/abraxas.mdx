## noun

In Gnostic and late antique magical tradition, a potent name often inscribed on engraved gems and amulets. The name was associated with a composite, lion-headed or cock-headed figure and invoked as a symbol of cosmic power and protection.

> *She wore the carved stone under her collarbone, an abraxas meant to turn aside illness and ill will alike.*

## Etymology

From Late Greek **Abrasax/Abraxas** (Ἀβραξάς), a name occurring in Gnostic contexts (notably Basilidian) and widely disseminated on so-called "magical gems." Antiquarians noted that its Greek letters can be read numerically as **365**, binding the name to the circuit of days. The deeper origin remains obscure, though its afterlife is clear: a word made talisman, carried forward by syncretic religion and later revived in modern occult and literary imagination.
