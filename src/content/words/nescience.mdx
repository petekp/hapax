## noun

Ignorance, especially considered as a state with consequences. What one does not know, and perhaps ought to. **Nescience** points to a deficit that matters: knowledge missing where judgment is required.

> *His nescience wasn’t innocence; it was the kind of not-knowing that comes from never bothering to look.*

## Etymology

From Latin **nescientia** "ignorance," from **nescire** "not to know." A scholastic naming of ignorance as a condition, not an excuse.
