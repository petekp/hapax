## noun

A Japanese aesthetic of beauty in imperfection and impermanence. The grace of weathered surfaces, asymmetry, quietness, and the honest marks of time. **Wabi-sabi** prizes the unforced: wear as truth, simplicity as depth.

> *The chipped cup was wabi-sabi in the hand: flawed, humble, and somehow more trustworthy than new porcelain.*

## Etymology

From Japanese **侘び (wabi)** and **寂び (sabi)**, terms that evolved from meanings of loneliness and desolation into an aesthetic of austere serenity and patina. The beauty is not despite time, but because of it.

- **patina** (the visible work of time)
- **austerity** (simplicity with intent)
