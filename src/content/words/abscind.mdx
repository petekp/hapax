## verb

To cut away with clean finality; to sever by decisive removal. Where *trim* and *prune* shape what remains, **abscind** separates completely, making a boundary where once there was continuity.

> *With one motion the surgeon abscinded the dead tissue, leaving a sharp edge that could begin again.*

## Etymology

From Latin **abscindere** "to cut off," from **ab-** "away" + **scindere** "to split, cleave." In English it has long carried an air of the scalpel and the statute, a learned verb for acts that cannot be undone.

## Related Words

- **excise** (cut out, often officially or surgically)
- **scission** (a splitting; division)
- **ablation** (removal, especially of material or tissue)
- **sever** (the plain-voiced near-synonym)
