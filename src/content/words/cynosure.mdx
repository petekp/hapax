## noun

1. A person or thing that draws all attention; the center toward which eyes and talk naturally turn (literary). A **cynosure** need not be famous, only magnetic.

> *At the crowded table she became the cynosure, not by performing, but by listening so well everyone wanted her regard.*

2. A guiding star; specifically, the constellation or star in Ursa Minor associated with the Pole Star (historical; poetic).

> *Sailors once took the cynosure as their quiet assurance that north could be trusted.*

## Etymology

From Greek **kynosoura** “dog’s tail” (**kyōn** “dog” + **oura** “tail”), a name applied to the “Little Bear” constellation. The leap from dog-tail to lodestar is a reminder of how navigation becomes metaphor: what guides the ship soon guides the gaze.

## Related Words

- **lodestar** (a guiding star; the closest poetic sibling)
- **polestar** (the navigational referent often implied)
- **focal point** (the neutral modern equivalent)
- **magnetism** (the figurative force cynosure suggests)
