## adjective

Dark, shadow-laden, obscure; thick with gloom as if light has been actively resisted (literary). Unlike *dim*, which is merely low light, **tenebrous** feels cavernous—darkness with depth and mood.

> *They entered the tenebrous nave, where candles looked like small negotiations with night.*

## Etymology

From Latin **tenebrosus**, from **tenebrae** “darkness.” The plural in Latin hints at layers: darkness as a collective.

- **eldritch** (eerie darkness with otherworldly flavor)
- **nocturnal** (of the night; neutral)
- **obscure** (hard to see or understand; less atmospheric)
- **chthonic** (underworld-dark; kin in tone)
