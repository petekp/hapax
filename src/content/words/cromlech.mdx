## noun

A prehistoric megalithic monument, especially a circle or arrangement of large standing stones; in some usages, a dolmen-like chambered structure (archaeological). A **cromlech** implies deliberation at scale, stones set into relation, making space ceremonial.

> *Mist pooled between the stones of the cromlech, and the modern path felt suddenly like an intrusion.*

## Etymology

From Welsh **cromlech**, often glossed as “bent stone” (**crom** “bent” + **llech** “slab/stone”), though antiquarian usage varied and the term has been applied unevenly across monument types. The word itself bears the history of interpretation: archaeology named by languages that still live near the stones.
