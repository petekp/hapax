## noun

A fine writing material made from prepared animal skin, prized for smoothness, durability, and the way ink seems to sit with quiet authority. **Vellum** carries the sense of permanence, text meant to outlast weather and politics.

> *The charter on vellum looked less written than engraved, as if the law had grown a skin.*

## Etymology
