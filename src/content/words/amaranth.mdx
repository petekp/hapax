## noun

1. A plant of the genus *Amaranthus*, many species bearing dense, tasselled blooms and long valued as ornament, grain, or leafy food.

> *Amaranth nodded at the fence line, its crimson plumes too extravagant to be merely “weeds.”*

2. In poetry and emblem, an "unfading" flower: symbol of immortality, undying fame, or love that outlasts decay.

> *He wrote her name beneath an amaranth that never wilted, as if ink could inherit the flower’s promise.*

## adjective

Of a deep purplish red, named for the bloom's color. It is richer than rose and duskier than scarlet.

> *An amaranth scarf in the gray crowd looked like a small, defiant sunrise.*

## Etymology

From Greek **amarantos** "unfading," from **a-** "not" + a verb related to **marainein** "to wither." The botanical word and the emblematic one braid together: a real plant lending color and form to an imagined immortality, and the imagined immortality lending resonance back.
