A person hungry for news and novelty, a busybody of information, always asking "what now?" A **quidnunc** is defined by curiosity's itch rather than craft or responsibility.

> *The quidnunc lingered at the doorway, collecting rumors the way others collect coins.*

## Etymology

From Latin **quid nunc?** "what now?" A question turned into a character type. English imported the phrase and kept its raised eyebrow.
