## noun

A hidden memory mistaken for original creation, a thought, phrase, or melody resurfacing without recognition of its source, so that recollection masquerades as invention (psychological; technical). **Cryptomnesia** is usually unintentional, authorship blurred by forgetting.

> *He was sure the tune was his until a friend hummed the rest of it; cryptomnesia had signed his name in invisible ink.*

## Etymology

Formed from Greek roots: **krypto-** “hidden” + **mnēsis** “remembrance.” The coinage is modern and diagnostic, naming a phenomenon as old as minds: memory working in disguise.
