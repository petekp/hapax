The dramatic interplay of light and dark in visual art, modeling form by contrast so that illumination becomes a kind of narrative (art). In **chiaroscuro**, darkness is not absence but design.

> *In the portrait’s chiaroscuro, half the face seemed confessed to the light while the other half kept its secrets.*

## Etymology

From Italian **chiaro** “clear, light” + **oscuro** “dark.” The term names a technique and, more subtly, a worldview: that meaning often lives in what is withheld as much as in what is shown.

## Related Words

- **tenebrism** (an intensified style of stark darkness and spotlight)
- **modeling** (the rendering of three-dimensional form on a flat surface)
- **contrast** (the governing principle)
- **grisaille** (painting in grays; another way of sculpting with value)
