The felt texture of experience as it is lived from inside. The redness of red, the sting of salt, the ache of nostalgia. Sensation can be treated as data, but **qualia** insists on privacy: experience as irreducibly personal.

> *He could describe the wavelength, but not the qualia—the particular red that made the memory hurt.*

## Etymology

From Latin **quale** "of what kind," pluralized in modern philosophy to name qualities of consciousness that resist reduction to measurement. A small word for a stubborn remainder.

## Related Words

- **phenomenology** (the study of experience as lived)
- **noumenon** (the “thing-in-itself”; often contrasted in discussions of knowability)
