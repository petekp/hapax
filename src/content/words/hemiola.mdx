## noun

A rhythmic ratio in which two beats are felt in the time of three, or vice versa, producing a momentary shift in pulse. An elegant misalignment that makes the music lean forward. Where syncopation displaces accents, **hemiola** is mathematical at heart: proportion turned into motion.

> *Just before the cadence, the hemiola arrived like a quick change of footing, and the choir seemed to lift off the barline.*

## Etymology

From Greek **hēmiolios** “one and a half,” from **hēmi-** “half” + **holos** “whole.” The word began as a numerical relation and became, in practice, a sensation: the body counting differently for a moment.

## Related Words

- **polyrhythm** (simultaneous rhythmic layers; a larger family resemblance)
- **syncopation** (accent displacement; often a fellow troublemaker)
- **meter** (the framework hemiola briefly unsettles)
- **sesquialtera** (a related ratio-term used in music theory)
