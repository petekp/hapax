A Russian word for a deep, often unnameable anguish or yearning. Restlessness, melancholy, spiritual ache, ranging from mild ennui to soul-sick despair. **Toska** can be objectless: pain without a clear "because."

> *He felt toska in the crowd’s noise—lonely not for lack of people, but for lack of meaning.*
