## noun

A rooster—especially as a poetic or storybook figure whose crow seems to conduct the morning (literary). Unlike *rooster* or *cock*, **chanticleer** is a name, not a label: it grants the bird a role and a voice.

> *Before the sun cleared the hill, the chanticleer rehearsed the day into existence with his sharp, bright cry.*

## Etymology

From Old French **Chantecler** “sing-clear,” a proper name given to the rooster in medieval beast tales (notably the cycle that includes Reynard the Fox). English kept the name as a common noun when it wanted a rooster with personality.

## Related Words

- **cockerel** (a young rooster; more literal, less storied)
- **cockcrow** (the time or event chanticleer announces)
- **bestiary** (the literary tradition that popularized the figure)
- **vesper** (evening counterpart in the day’s liturgical imagination)
