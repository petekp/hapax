## noun

A swastika-like cross with arms bent at right angles, used historically as a decorative or symbolic motif in European contexts. In modern English, often chosen when naming the form while distancing it from its 20th-century political appropriation.

> *In the church floor the fylfot appeared among other medieval tiles, ornament that history would later darken with borrowed meaning.*

## Etymology

A Middle English term of uncertain origin, long used in heraldic and antiquarian description. The word survives because precision matters: to distinguish the ancient geometric figure, found across many cultures and centuries, from the narrower meanings later imposed upon it.
