In former times; once (archaic; literary).

> *Erstwhile, the street had been all small shops; now it was glass and silence.*

## Etymology

From Middle English **erst whil(e)** “at first, earlier,” from **erst** “formerly” + **while** “time.” The word is time made compact: a formerness you can say in one breath.
