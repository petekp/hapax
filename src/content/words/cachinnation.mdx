## noun

A loud, often coarse outburst of laughter—laughter that announces itself, sometimes at another’s expense (formal, rare). Where *laughter* can be gentle or private, **cachinnation** is public and unmistakable.

> *Her cachinnation rose above the orchestra like an unscripted cymbal crash.*

## Etymology

From Latin **cachinnātiō**, from **cachinnāre** “to laugh loudly.” The suffix gives the sound a formality it almost resists—rowdy laughter dressed in academic robes.

## Related Words

- **cachinnate** (to laugh in this way)
- **titter** (a smaller, more contained laugh)
- **guffaw** (boisterous laughter without the learned register)
- **raucous** (the timbre cachinnation often carries)
