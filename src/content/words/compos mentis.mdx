## adjective

Of sound mind; in possession of one's mental faculties, especially in a legal or formal judgment of capacity (formal). **Compos mentis** is measured and evidentiary, a mind accounted for.

> *The will was upheld because, on the day she signed it, she was compos mentis—clear-eyed, steady, and uncoerced.*

## Etymology

From Latin **compos mentis** "in control of the mind," literally "master of one's mind," from **compos** "having control" + **mentis**, genitive of **mens** "mind." English preserves the phrase as a small island of Latin in modern law.

## Related Words

- **capacity** (the legal concept often at issue)
- **lucid** (clear-minded; less formal)
- **non compos mentis** (the traditional opposite phrase)
- **competent** (everyday legal-adjacent synonym)
