One of two equal parts; a half, especially in legal, formal, or technical division. Where *half* is common and blunt, **moiety** treats partition as concept, division recognized and named.

> *By the treaty each side claimed a moiety of the land, as if geography could be halved by ink.*

## Etymology

From Old French **moitié** “half,” from Latin **medietas** “middle-ness,” from **medius** “middle.” The word’s history reveals an older sense: half as what lies midway, a portion defined by relationship.
