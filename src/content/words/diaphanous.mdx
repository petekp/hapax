So thin as to let light through, translucent with a delicate, almost immaterial clarity. Light passes, but softness remains. A diaphanous fabric keeps its veil even as it reveals.

> *A diaphanous curtain lifted in the afternoon breeze, turning the sun into something tender.*

## Etymology

From Greek **diaphanēs** “transparent,” from **dia-** “through” + **phainein** “to show.” The word’s history is a lesson in light: not merely seen, but *carried through*.
