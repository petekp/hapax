A dungeon-like pit accessed only through an opening above, used for confinement where the architecture itself enforces disappearance. An **oubliette** is designed not merely to hold but to erase, to make forgetting structural.

> *The stair ended in stone; the oubliette began in silence, as if the building had learned how to swallow people.*

## Etymology

From French **oubliette**, from **oublier** “to forget,” from **oubli** “forgetting.” The word is chillingly literal: a place built for oblivion.
