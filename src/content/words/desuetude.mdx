## noun

Disuse through long neglect; the state of something—law, custom, word, ritual—left behind until it no longer governs and is barely remembered (formal). Unlike *obsolescence*, which can be caused by replacement, **desuetude** suggests quiet abandonment: a fading out rather than a superseding.

> *The ordinance remained on the books, but in desuetude—ignored so completely it had become a legal ghost.*

## Etymology

From Latin **dēsūētūdō** “unaccustomedness,” from **de-** “away from” + **suēscere** “to become accustomed” (related to **suētus** “accustomed”). What falls into desuetude is not defeated; it is simply no longer practiced, and practice is how rules stay alive.

## Related Words

- **obsolescence** (falling out of use, often by being overtaken)
- **atavism** (a reappearance from the past—what desuetude sometimes hides)
- **archaic** (a label for what desuetude can produce)
- **moribund** (dying; often said of institutions or practices)
