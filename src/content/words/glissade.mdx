## noun

A swift descent down a steep slope, especially on snow or scree, by sliding in a controlled rush. Half travel, half surrender. Where a *slide* may be accidental, a **glissade** is chosen: gravity enlisted as technique.

> *They saved their legs for the climb and took a glissade down the couloir, laughter skimming ahead of them.*

## verb

To descend in this manner. To slide down deliberately and, ideally, safely.

> *At the last pitch of snow, she glissaded to the basin, boots carving brief parentheses in white.*

## Etymology

From French **glissade**, from **glisser** “to slide,” ultimately from a Frankish (Germanic) root akin to English *glide*. The word keeps the grace note of the act: descent as motion made elegant.
