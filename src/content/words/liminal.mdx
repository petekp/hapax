## adjective

Of a threshold: occupying an in-between state where categories loosen and transition is the main fact—neither one thing nor the other, but poised, unsettled, and charged (literary; also anthropological). Unlike *intermediate*, which can be purely measurable, **liminal** implies atmosphere: the strange electricity of crossing.

> *The empty hallway at dusk felt liminal, as though the building were waiting to become something else.*

## Etymology

From Latin **limen** “threshold.” First a physical edge, then a concept: the doorway becoming a way to think about rites, passages, and the eerie familiar of “almost.”

## Related Words

- **betwixt** (an older between-word with similar mood)
- **threshold** (the literal source image)
- **interstitial** (in the spaces between; more technical)
- **transitional** (process-focused cousin)
