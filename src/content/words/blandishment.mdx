## noun

Flattering enticement. Coaxing sweetness used as leverage. A *compliment* may be sincere, but **blandishment** is praise with a purpose. Soft words shaped to turn someone gently where they might not otherwise go.

> *She yielded, not to logic, but to the blandishments that made refusal feel like rudeness.*

## Etymology

From **blandish** "to flatter, cajole," ultimately from Latin **blandus** "smooth-tongued, charming." The root idea is tactile. Speech made velvet, so the hand can slip in.

## Related Words

- **wheedling** (insistent, often slightly contemptible persuasion)
- **suasion** (persuasion, often gentle; more neutral)
- **flattery** (the broader category blandishment weaponizes)
