## noun

A full cycle of day and night: twenty-four hours taken as a single unit, with darkness acknowledged as half the measure. A **nychthemeron** insists on wholeness, light and dark as one completed turn.

> *After three nychthemera at sea, his sense of weekday and weekend dissolved into pure rotation.*

## Etymology

From Greek **nychthēmeron**, from **nyx/nych-** "night" + **hēmera** "day." A stitched seam of time: night and day yoked into one term, as they are in lived experience.
