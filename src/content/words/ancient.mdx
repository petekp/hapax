## adjective

Of great age, long past its beginning; belonging to remote times, and carrying the authority (or the estrangement) of what has endured beyond living memory. **Ancient** suggests depth, layering, and the hush of distance.

> *The path felt ancient, not because it was ruined, but because it seemed to know where feet had always gone.*

## noun

A standard-bearer; the officer charged with carrying a flag or ensign.

> *In the muster roll the ancient is named with the same care as the captain: the banner had to be trusted to steady hands.*

## Etymology

From Old French **ancien** "old, former," ultimately related to Latin **ante** "before." The word's history mirrors its meaning, carried forward from earlier speech, accruing patina as it passes through centuries.
