## noun

A figure of speech in which one word (often a verb) governs two others in different senses, yoking them together with a seam that shows. **Zeugma** thrives on strain: the shared word fits one object cleanly and the other with a twist.

> *She lost her keys and her patience—zeugma making one verb do double duty, and letting the wit show in the stitching.*

## Etymology

From Greek **zeugma** “a yoking,” from **zeugnynai** “to yoke.” The term is its own definition: linkage that binds.
