Evening. The time of day when light falls into its last clear notes. Also, evening prayer in Christian tradition. **Vesper** is a threshold word: day's closing, not darkness's full possession.

> *At vesper the streetlamps blinked on, and the world seemed to exhale its working voice.*

## Etymology

From Latin **vesper** “evening; evening star.” The word carries both hour and planet, as if dusk had always been celestial.
