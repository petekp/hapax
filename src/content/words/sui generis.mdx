Of its own kind, belonging to no established class, resisting comparison not by superiority but by singularity. Where *unique* can be casual praise, **sui generis** is taxonomic: a label for what refuses the label.

> *Her work was sui generis—recognizably itself before it was recognizably anything else.*

## Etymology

From Latin **sui** "of itself" + **generis** "of a kind, genus." A tidy paradox: classification used to declare the unclassifiable.

## Related Words

- **incomparable** (singular by relation to others)
- **idiosyncratic** (distinctive in personal ways)
- **unprecedented** (without prior example)
- **hapax** (once-only in a corpus; rarity in evidence)
