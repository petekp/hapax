## noun

A bright spot or "mock moon" appearing beside the moon, typically as part of a halo display in ice-crystal clouds. Moonlight refracted into a secondary apparition. A **paraselene** stands apart from the halo that encircles, a companion light that looks like an echo.

> *Two pale paraselenae hovered on either side of the moon, as if night had grown parentheses of light.*

## Etymology

From Greek **para-** "beside" + **selēnē** "moon." Diagrammatic: it tells you where to look, next to the moon, not at it.
