## noun

> *In the old photograph, her lineaments were already there—the sharp brow, the steady mouth—like a signature the years would not revise.*

2. A defining characteristic or outline of something more abstract. The lineaments of a plan, an era, a temperament (formal).

> *The novel’s lineaments emerged slowly: a quiet grief, a stubborn hope, a city always on the verge of rain.*
