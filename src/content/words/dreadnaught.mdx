## noun

A heavily armored battleship of the early 20th century type, built around big-gun firepower. By extension, anything formidable through sheer mass and menace. This spelling is a less common variant of *dreadnought*.

> *The harbor seemed to shrink around the dreadnaught, as if water itself made room for steel.*

## Etymology

Variant spelling of **dreadnought**, originally “one who fears nothing,” from **dread** + **nought** “nothing.” The famous battleship name turned a boast into a category, and the category into a symbol of modern power.
