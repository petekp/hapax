## noun

A teacher or instructor, especially one who guides by example and discipline as much as by information. A **preceptor** implies tutelage, learning shaped at close range, with standards quietly enforced.

> *Her preceptor corrected her Latin without impatience, as though precision were a form of kindness.*

## Etymology

From Latin **praeceptor** "teacher," from **praecipere** "to advise, instruct," literally "to take beforehand." The root suggests foreknowledge. The preceptor sees the next mistake coming and steadies the student before it arrives.

## Related Words

- **mentor** (guidance with a more personal, less disciplinary tone)
- **tutor** (close instruction; often narrower in scope)
- **pedagogue** (teacher; sometimes colored by severity)
- **didactic** (instructional; the manner a preceptor may adopt)
