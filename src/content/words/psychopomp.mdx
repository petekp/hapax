## noun

A guide of souls: a being who escorts the dead from the world of the living to whatever lies beyond, across thresholds that are not meant to be crossed alone (mythological; literary). Unlike a *reaper*, who may take, a **psychopomp** accompanies—death rendered as passage with an attendant.

> *In the old tale the raven was no omen but a psychopomp, patient as dusk, waiting to lead the lost home.*

## Etymology

From Greek **psychopompos**, from **psychē** “soul” + **pompos** “guide, conductor.” The name is matter-of-fact about a metaphysical job: escort, not judgment.
