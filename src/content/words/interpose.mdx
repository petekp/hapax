## verb

1. Place or wedge between; insert as a barrier, buffer, or separating presence (formal).

> *He interposed his arm between the dog and the child, not striking, merely making a boundary.*

2. Offer or inject (an opinion, objection, or plea), often at a critical moment (formal).

> *Before the argument could harden into cruelty, she interposed a single question that made them both pause.*

## Etymology

From Latin **interponere** “to put between,” from **inter** “between” + **ponere** “to place.” The word keeps the gesture in it: an act of “between-ness” meant to alter what would otherwise happen.
