## adjective

Flesh-colored, especially flushed with deep red; blood-tinged as if life itself had risen close to the surface (literary). Unlike *crimson*, which is purely color, **incarnadine** carries bodily implication: redness with skin beneath it.

> *Sunset incarnadined the snow, and the valley looked briefly alive with a strange, warm blush.*

## verb

Turn red, especially as if stained with blood (literary).

> *The tide incarnadined around the net, and the fishermen grew suddenly quiet.*

## Etymology

From Italian **incarnadino** “flesh-colored,” from **incarnare** “to make flesh,” from Latin **incarnare** (**in-** “in” + **caro/carn-** “flesh”). The word’s color is inseparable from its metaphor: redness as embodiment.

- **incarnate** (made flesh; etymological kin)
- **sanguine** (blood-red; also temperament)
