## verb

1. Drink, especially steadily or deeply; take in liquid (formal).

> *He imbibed the bitter espresso slowly, letting its heat argue him awake.*

2. Absorb or soak up ideas, moods, or influences as if the mind had pores (formal; often figurative). The uptake happens by immersion rather than instruction.

> *Living there, she imbibed the city’s rhythms until her own thoughts began to keep its hours.*

## Etymology

From Latin **imbibere** “to drink in,” from **in-** “in” + **bibere** “to drink.” The figurative sense is old and natural: what we take in becomes part of us, whether liquid or language.

- **quaff** (drink heartily; more boisterous)
- **saturate** (to fill completely; often the end-state of imbibing)
