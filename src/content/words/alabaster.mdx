## noun

1. A fine-grained, often translucent stone, commonly gypsum (and sometimes calcite), valued for carving and for the way light seems to linger within it.

> *In the museum’s quiet, the alabaster figure glowed as if it had been filled with moonlight and sealed.*

2. A pale, smooth, luminous whiteness, evocative of that stone.

> *Her alabaster throat caught the candle’s tremble, and even the air looked softer for it.*

## adjective

Pale and softly luminous, with a smoothness that suggests carved stone.

> *Alabaster clouds drifted over the lake, bright but not harsh, as though the day had been polished.*

## Etymology

From Latin **alabaster**, from Greek **alabastros/alabastos**, used of both the stone and the small perfume vessels (*alabastron*) often made from it. The ultimate origin is uncertain and much debated, but the semantic loop is clear: material and vessel naming each other.

## Related Words

- **gypsum** (the common mineral form of alabaster)
- **calcite** (the other principal material called “alabaster”)
- **marble** (a near-substitute lacking alabaster’s softness and glow)
- **ivory** (shared connotations of smooth pale luxury)
