1. Omit a sound or syllable in pronunciation, especially to fit meter or ease speech. The omission is surgical, absence created by rule or rhythm.

> *In the poem he elided the vowel so the line could move without stumbling.*

2. Pass over or leave out (often deliberately), especially in narration or argument (formal).

> *The report elided the most troubling detail, and the omission was louder than any sentence.*

## Etymology

From Latin **elīdere** “to strike out,” from **e-** “out” + **laedere** “to dash, strike.” The older physical violence survives as metaphor: something removed by impact, then smoothed into silence.

- **apocope** (loss of a final sound; a specific kind of elision)
- **syncope** (loss from the middle; another specific kind)
