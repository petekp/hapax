## noun

1. A painful, inflamed cluster of boils—an angry knot of infection under the skin (medical). Unlike a *pimple*, a **carbuncle** is deep, hot, and serious.

> *The fever began as a carbuncle on his shoulder, a small fire the body couldn’t easily put out.*

2. A deep red gemstone, especially a garnet, described in older writing as if it held a coal-like inner glow (historical).

> *In the lamplight the carbuncle looked alive, a red that seemed to remember flame.*

## Etymology

From Latin **carbunculus** “little coal,” diminutive of **carbo** “coal.” The metaphor split into two lives: the disease named for its fiery inflammation, and the stone named for its ember-red shine.
