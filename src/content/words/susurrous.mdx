## adjective

Whispering, rustling, softly hissing. Sound like dry leaves or distant rain, intimate enough to feel almost spoken. **Susurrous** is textured: silence with syllables.

> *A susurrous wind moved through the reeds, and the lake seemed to keep secrets aloud.*

## Etymology

From Latin **susurrus** “a whispering, murmuring,” an echo-word whose repeated sibilants imitate the sound it names.

- **murmurous** (softly murmuring; broader)
