## noun

A longing for far-off places, an ache for distance itself, as if the horizon were a summons rather than a line. Where *wanderlust* can sound cheerful, **fernweh** often carries a sweeter pain: homesickness turned inside out, pointed toward elsewhere.

> *On quiet afternoons, fernweh would take him by the throat, and even the map on his wall seemed to rustle.*

## Etymology

Borrowed from German **Fernweh**, literally “far-sickness,” formed on the model of **Heimweh** “homesickness” (**fern** “far” + **Weh** “pain, woe”). The coinage is modern, but the feeling is old: restlessness given a diagnostic name.

## Related Words

- **hiraeth** (longing with homesickness; different direction, similar ache)
- **nostalgia** (longing for the past; a temporal cousin)
- **itchy feet** (idiomatic equivalent; less lyrical)
