## adverb

In truth; indeed—used as an emphatic or sometimes ironic intensifier, now chiefly in archaic or mock-archaic style (archaic). Unlike plain *indeed*, **forsooth** carries a faint stage-light: sincerity performed, or sincerity parodied.

> *“Forsooth,” he said with a bow, and the room understood at once that he was teasing.*

## Etymology

From Middle English **for sothe** “for truth,” from **for** “for” + **sooth** “truth.” The word preserves **sooth**—once a common noun—inside a fossil phrase that still tastes of old seriousness.
