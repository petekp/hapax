## adjective

Shining at night; luminous in darkness—especially of clouds that glow after sunset with a cold, high-altitude light (scientific; also poetic). Unlike *phosphorescent*, which implies stored light, **noctilucent** names the circumstance: light that belongs to night.

> *Above the darkened city, noctilucent clouds hung like pale brushstrokes the sun had not quite let go.*

## Etymology

From Latin **nocti-** “night” + **lucent-** “shining,” from **lucēre** “to shine.” The word is a small astronomy lesson: night, too, can have its radiance.

## Related Words
