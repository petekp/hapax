A rapid, involuntary jerk of the eye as it shifts focus from one point to another, the tiny leap by which vision samples the world in discrete glances. A **saccade** is a jump, seeing as a succession of quick, stitched-together fixations.

> *In the interview, her eyes made small saccades toward the door, as if her attention kept checking for escape.*

## Etymology

From French **saccade** "jerk," from **saccader** "to jolt." Science borrowed the everyday word and narrowed it, naming a motion most people never notice they're making.

## Related Words

- **fixation** (the steadier pause between saccades)
- **nystagmus** (involuntary oscillation of the eyes; different pattern)
- **proprioception** (another “silent” sense; kin in hidden bodily knowledge)
- **gaze** (the experienced whole that saccades construct)
