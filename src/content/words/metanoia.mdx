## noun

A profound change of mind or heart, a turning that reorients one's inner life. Repentance in the older theological sense, but also transformation without explicit religious frame. Where *regret* looks backward, **metanoia** implies new direction, a turning toward what must be.

> *His apology carried metanoia—no theatrics, only the quiet sense that he had become someone else.*

## Etymology

From Greek **metánoia** “change of mind,” from **meta-** “after; beyond” + **nous** “mind.” In early Christian usage it was tied to repentance, but the root idea is broader and enduring: thought remade after an encounter with truth.

## Related Words

- **repentance** (the common theological equivalent)
- **conversion** (a turning; often religious, sometimes ideological)
- **reformation** (change in form or behavior; more external)
