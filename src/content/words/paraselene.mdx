## noun

A bright spot or “mock moon” appearing beside the moon, typically as part of a halo display in ice-crystal clouds—moonlight refracted into a secondary apparition (meteorological; technical). Unlike a *halo*, which encircles, a **paraselene** stands apart: a companion light that looks like an echo.

> *Two pale paraselenae hovered on either side of the moon, as if night had grown parentheses of light.*

## Etymology

From Greek **para-** “beside” + **selēnē** “moon.” The word is diagrammatic: it tells you where to look—next to the moon, not at it.

## Related Words

- **parhelion** (a “sun dog,” the solar analogue)
- **halo** (the broader optical phenomenon)
- **cirrostratus** (cloud type often associated with halos)
- **refraction** (the physical mechanism behind the sight)
