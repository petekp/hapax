The act or state of growing warm; a gradual warming, often the first perceptible turn toward heat (scientific; rare). **Calescence** can feel almost spontaneous, warmth as an awakening.

> *At dawn the stones began their calescence, releasing yesterday’s sun into the cool air.*

## Etymology

From Latin **calēscere** "to grow warm," from **calēre** "to be warm." English preserves the inchoative sense: the becoming, not merely the being.

## Related Words

- **incandescence** (glowing from heat; a later, brighter stage)
- **caloric** (pertaining to heat)
- **thermogenesis** (heat production in organisms; more technical)
- **warming** (the plain counterpart)
