The soft whispering or rustling sound of wind in leaves, or more broadly, any hushed, sibilant murmuring that feels like speech without words. **Psithurism** suggests intimacy, the world confiding rather than merely moving.

> *At night the garden’s psithurism crept through the window, and the curtains seemed to breathe along with it.*

## Etymology

From Greek **psithyrizein** “to whisper,” a word that nearly performs its meaning: consonants like dry leaves, vowels like breath. English keeps it as a specialist’s delight—sound named with sound.

- **sibilant** (hissing sound; phonetic kin)
- **murmur** (a more common near-synonym)
