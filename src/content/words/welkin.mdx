## noun

The sky, especially as a lofty vault; the heavens as an old, resonant backdrop to weather and wonder (poetic; archaic). Unlike *sky*, which is plain, **welkin** sounds like distance—blue made mythic.

> *Thunder rolled across the welkin, and the fields listened like a congregation.*

## Etymology

From Old English **wolcen** “cloud; sky,” related to Germanic words for cloud. The word drifted from “cloud” to “heaven” as poetry lifted it.

## Related Words

- **firmament** (the sky as structure; close kin)
- **empyrean** (the highest heaven; more theological)
- **azure** (the color often implied)
- **vault** (the metaphor welkin invites)
