## interjection

An exclamation of sorrow, resignation, or rueful surprise—“alas” with an older cadence (archaic; literary). Unlike *oh no*, which is immediate, **wellaway** feels seasoned: grief that has learned to speak politely.

> *“Wellaway,” she murmured, reading the last line, as if the paper had delivered a small bereavement.*

## Etymology

From Middle English expressions akin to “well away!” used as lament; the exact path is tangled, but the tone is clear: a sigh crystallized into a word.

- **forsooth** (fellow archaic flavor, though not mournful)

- **threnody** (lament in extended, artful form)
