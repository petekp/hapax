The quality of being obligatory; the felt or argued "must" of a situation. **Oughtness** names the bare force of obligation itself, the normative pressure that claims authority over choice.

> *He could explain what was useful, but not the oughtness that made kindness feel nonnegotiable.*

## Etymology

From **ought** + the abstract-noun suffix **-ness**. A plain modal verb is turned into a concept: grammar hardened into ethics.

## Related Words

- **deontic** (pertaining to duty and obligation; technical)
- **imperative** (a command; grammatical cousin with moral reach)
- **scruple** (the inner friction often generated by oughtness)
