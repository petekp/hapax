## noun

1. A complete suit of armor; full ceremonial or battle array (historical).

> *In the museum the knight’s panoply stood empty, a steel skin waiting for a body that would never return.*

2. A splendid or impressive array of things; a full display in abundance and variety (formal).

## Etymology

From Greek **panoplia** “full armor,” from **pan-** “all” + **hopla** “arms, equipment.” The word widened naturally from literal armament to figurative abundance: completeness as spectacle.
