## adjective

Of a star or planet: rising at sunset, or in older usage, visible at nightfall. Its appearance belongs to the hinge between day's last light and the first full dark. Where *nocturnal* merely names the hours, **acronychal** marks a specific celestial timing, an appointment kept with dusk.

> *By late autumn the star’s acronychal rise became a small ceremony: dinner cleared, windows opened, sky admitted.*

## Etymology

From Greek **akronychos** "at the beginning of night," from **akros** "highest; extreme" + **nyx** "night." The word entered English through the language of observational astronomy, where naming became a way of keeping faith with recurrence.
