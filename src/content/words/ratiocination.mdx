Formal, step-by-step reasoning, logic worked through with deliberate, sometimes relentless precision. Intuition arrives whole, but **ratiocination** arrives assembled, each inference clicking into the next like a well-made chain.

> *Her ratiocination was flawless, but the room still resisted—proof and persuasion are not always the same craft.*

## Etymology

From Latin **ratiocinari** "to reason," from **ratio** "reckoning, account, reason." Thought as calculation, argument as ledger.
