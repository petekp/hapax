## adverb

Perhaps; possibly—an old-fashioned, lightly whimsical way of letting uncertainty into a sentence (archaic; literary). Unlike *maybe*, which is casual, **mayhap** feels like a small courtesy to chance.

> *Mayhap we’ll meet again, she said, as if the future were a door left politely ajar.*

## Etymology

From Middle English **may hap** “it may happen,” a compression of modal and event into one airy word. The phrase fossilized into an adverb that still sounds like possibility arriving on tiptoe.

## Related Words

- **perhaps** (the standard equivalent)
- **perchance** (another archaic “perhaps,” slightly more formal)
- **hap** (chance; surviving in *hapless* and *happen*)
- **fortuitous** (happening by chance; more Latinate)
