## adjective

Headless; lacking a head or chief—said of organisms without a distinct “head” region, or of groups and movements without centralized leadership (technical; also figurative). **Acephalous** is not simply *leaderless*: it suggests a structure built to proceed without a single governing crown.

> *The protest was acephalous by design, a thousand small decisions instead of one loud command.*

## Etymology

From Greek **akephalos** “headless,” from **a-** “without” + **kephalē** “head,” transmitted through learned Latin and scientific English. The word’s literal anatomy became, readily and often, a political metaphor.
