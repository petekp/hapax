## noun

The mind's habit of finding meaningful forms in randomness. Faces in clouds, animals in rock, messages in static. **Pareidolia** is pattern-recognition spilling beyond its evidence, insisting it has discovered something that was already there.

> *On the plaster ceiling he saw a profile watching him—pareidolia turning water stains into company.*

## Etymology

From Greek **para-** "beside; wrong" + **eidōlon/eidos** "image; form." Gently corrective: an image "beside" the real one, produced by perception's hunger for meaning.

## Related Words

- **apophenia** (perceiving patterns or connections broadly, often more abstract)
- **illusion** (the larger category)
- **face perception** (a cognitive specialty that pareidolia often recruits)
- **projection** (attributing inner content outward; adjacent, not identical)
