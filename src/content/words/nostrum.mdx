## noun

A supposed remedy, especially a quack medicine promoted as a cure-all; a solution sold with more certainty than evidence (often pejorative). Unlike a legitimate *treatment*, a **nostrum** trades in promise: relief packaged as persuasion.

> *He offered a nostrum for every grief—sleep, money, love—each one conveniently available for a fee.*

## Etymology

From Latin **nostrum** “ours,” as in **remedium nostrum** “our remedy,” originally the proprietary mixture of a seller. The possessive became suspicious: what is “ours” is not necessarily true—only owned.

## Related Words

- **panacea** (a cure-all; sometimes sincere, often not)
- **quackery** (the practice that produces nostrums)
- **elixir** (a romanticized near-synonym, less inherently dubious)
- **snake oil** (idiomatic modern equivalent)
