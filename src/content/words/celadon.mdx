A pale gray-green color, cool and softened, slightly milky, named for the glaze of certain ceramics and suggestive of jade seen through mist (art; design).

> *The bowl’s celadon glaze held light the way still water holds sky—quietly, without glare.*

## adjective

Of that color.

> *She chose celadon paint for the bedroom, a green that calmed without turning cold.*

## Etymology

From French **céladon**, the name of a shepherd character who wore pale green ribbons in a popular 17th-century pastoral romance; the name then attached itself to the admired green of Chinese ceramics in European taste. The word is a lesson in how fashion christens color.
