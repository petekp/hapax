## noun

An arrangement of five points with four at the corners of a square or rectangle and one in the center, like the five on a die. Also, anything patterned by that geometry. A **quincunx** is instantly visual: order with a held center.

> *The orchard was planted in a quincunx, each tree given space as if symmetry were a kind of patience.*

## Etymology

From Latin **quincunx**, originally "five-twelfths," and by extension the five-spot pattern used in Roman numerals and design. Arithmetic turning into ornament.
