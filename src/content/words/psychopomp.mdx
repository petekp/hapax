A guide of souls. A being who escorts the dead from the world of the living to whatever lies beyond, across thresholds not meant to be crossed alone. A **psychopomp** accompanies rather than takes, death rendered as passage with an attendant.

> *In the old tale the raven was no omen but a psychopomp, patient as dusk, waiting to lead the lost home.*

## Etymology

From Greek **psychopompos**, from **psychē** "soul" + **pompos** "guide, conductor." Matter-of-fact about a metaphysical job: escort, not judgment.
