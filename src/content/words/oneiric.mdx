## adjective

Dreamlike in quality. Hushed, illogically vivid, and saturated with the sense that meaning is present but slippery. **Oneiric** suggests a quieter strangeness than *fantastic*, the world slightly unlatched.

> *The streetlights blurred in the rain, and the whole walk home turned oneiric, as if he were remembering it while still inside it.*

## Etymology

From Greek **oneiros** “dream,” via learned formation in modern European languages. The adjective keeps the ancient root intact, but lends it a clinical elegance—dreamness treated as a describable atmosphere.

- **hypnagogic** (of the state on the edge of sleep)
- **phantasmagoric** (dreamlike, but more lurid and theatrical)
