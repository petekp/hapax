## noun

A dark, visceral artistry—especially in Spanish tradition—where performance feels possessed by an intimate intensity: not polish, but pulse; not prettiness, but truth with teeth (cultural; literary). Unlike *inspiration*, which can seem airy, **duende** rises from the body and the wound, and leaves the listener changed.

> *Her voice had duende—something raw and exact that made the room go still, as if everyone had been addressed by name.*

## Etymology

Borrowed from Spanish **duende**, originally “goblin; household spirit,” from a phrase meaning “owner of the house” (**dueño de casa**), compressed in colloquial speech. The supernatural sense became aesthetic: a spirit not of mischief but of haunting force, invoked most famously to name the inexplicable authority of certain singers and poets.

## Related Words

- **pathos** (emotional weight, though duende is rougher, less merely tender)
- **numinous** (awe-filled presence; more sacred, less bodily)
- **charisma** (personal magnetism; usually brighter, less shadowed)
