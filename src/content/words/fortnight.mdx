## noun

A period of two weeks. Fourteen nights counted as a unit, as if time were measured by darkness more naturally than by days. Chiefly British, though also literary elsewhere. Where *two weeks* is plain measurement, **fortnight** feels calendrical and old-fashioned, a named span with edges.

> *They promised to return in a fortnight, and the word made the wait feel both shorter and more ceremonial.*

## Etymology

From Old English **fēowertyne niht** “fourteen nights,” later compressed into **fortnight**. The word remembers an older habit of counting time by nights—winter-minded arithmetic.

## Related Words

- **sennight** (a period of seven nights; later in your list)
- **biweekly** (ambiguous modern term; fortnight is clearer)
- **week** (the component measure)
- **nychthemeron** (a learned “day-and-night” unit; far more technical)
