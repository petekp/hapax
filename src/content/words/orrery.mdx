## noun

A mechanical model of the solar system, designed to show the motions of planets (and often moons) around the sun. Cosmos rendered as clockwork you can turn with your hand. An **orrery** makes time visible where a static diagram cannot.

> *He set the orrery spinning, and the little spheres began their patient circling as if eternity could be cranked.*

## Etymology

Named for the Earl of Orrery, associated with such devices in early modern England. A title became a noun because the instrument itself felt aristocratic. Precision, polish, and the ambition to miniature the heavens.
