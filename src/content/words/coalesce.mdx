Come together into a single whole, with particles, people, ideas, or factions merging until the seam is hard to find (formal). To **coalesce** implies fusion, many becoming one.

> *By midnight the scattered complaints had coalesced into a plan, and the room felt suddenly purposeful.*

## Etymology

From Latin **coalescere** “to grow together,” from **co-** “together” + **alescere** “to grow” (inchoative of **alere** “to nourish”). The word’s core metaphor is organic: union as a kind of shared growth.

- **accrete** (to grow by gradual addition; slower than coalescence)
