## noun

A traitor who collaborates with an enemy occupying power; a person who betrays their own side for advantage or ideology (historical; still potent). Unlike a generic *turncoat*, **quisling** carries the chill of civic treason—betrayal under pressure, when loyalty is most costly.

> *In the small town’s memory, his name became a quisling’s—spoken softly, as if betrayal could still be contagious.*

## Etymology

From the surname of Vidkun Quisling, the Norwegian politician whose collaboration during World War II made his name a byword. Few words show so starkly how history can forge vocabulary: a life reduced to a caution.
