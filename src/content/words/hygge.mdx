## noun

A Danish sense of cozy well-being. Warmth, intimacy, and simple comfort made deliberate: candles against winter, shared food, the feeling of being safely inside life. Where *coziness* is circumstance, **hygge** implies an ethic of atmosphere, care expressed through small arrangements.

> *They didn't decorate so much as practice hygge, lamplight softened, soup steaming, conversation unhurried into belonging.*

## Etymology

Borrowed from Danish **hygge**, related to a Scandinavian verb meaning “to comfort, to console,” with deeper roots in Old Norse. The word’s modern global travel has turned a local habit into a concept, but its heart remains domestic: refuge made visible.
