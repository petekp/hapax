## verb

Wink or blink; close and open the eyelids in a quick, often reflexive motion (rare; scientific). Unlike *blink*, **nictate** feels observed—an action noted by a clinician or a careful watcher.

> *In the glare, he nictated rapidly, his eyes trying to negotiate with the light.*

## Etymology

From Latin **nictāre** “to wink,” a frequentative form related to **nictāre/nīcere** “to wink or move quickly.” The word’s crispness imitates the act: brief, tight, repeated.

## Related Words

- **blink** (plain equivalent)
- **nictitation** (the act or frequency of blinking)
- **wink** (often more deliberate than nictation)
- **reflex** (the involuntary engine behind it)
