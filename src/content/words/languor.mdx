## noun

A dreamy weariness; a slowed vitality that can be either illness-like or voluptuously restful—energy lowered into softness (literary). Unlike mere *fatigue*, **languor** often carries a sensual stillness: the body unhurried, the mind drifting.

> *Afternoon languor settled over the house, and even the clocks seemed to tick more quietly.*

## Etymology

From Latin **langor** “faintness, listlessness,” from **languēre** “to be faint, to droop.” English inherited both the weakness and the elegance, allowing the word to mean collapse—or leisure masquerading as it.

## Related Words

- **lassitude** (weariness; often more neutral and physical)
- **ennui** (mental weariness; a different kind of drain)
- **torpor** (sluggishness; colder, more inert)
- **insouciance** (carefree ease; sometimes mistaken for languor)
