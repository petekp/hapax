## noun

1. A ghost; an apparition—something seen or sensed that is not materially present (literary; also general).

> *A phantom crossed the hallway in the mirror’s corner, and when she turned there was only air.*

2. Something illusory yet influential: a fear, pain, menace, or hope that persists despite lacking substance (often figurative).

> *Even after the debt was paid, the phantom of it lingered—every purchase still felt like a risk.*

## adjective

Illusory; existing only in appearance or perception.

> *He woke with phantom music in his ears, a melody his mind refused to release.*

## Etymology

From Greek **phantasma** “apparition,” from **phainein** “to show.” A phantom is, etymologically, something “shown”—a reminder that seeing is not the same as having.
