## verb

Wink or blink; close and open the eyelids in a quick, often reflexive motion. **Nictate** has a clinical air, an action noted by a careful observer rather than casually described.

> *In the glare, he nictated rapidly, his eyes trying to negotiate with the light.*

## Etymology

From Latin **nictāre** "to wink," a frequentative form related to **nictāre/nīcere** "to wink or move quickly." The crispness of the word imitates the act. Brief, tight, repeated.
