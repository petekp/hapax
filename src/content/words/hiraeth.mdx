A deep longing for home, especially a home that is gone, changed, or perhaps never truly existed. Homesickness braided with grief, memory, and the ache of the irrecoverable. A Welsh word with untranslatable nuance. Where *nostalgia* can be pleasantly bittersweet, **hiraeth** is desire that knows it cannot be satisfied.

> *On bright days abroad, hiraeth would arrive without warning, and even the air would seem to speak with an accent she missed.*

## Etymology

From Welsh **hiraeth**, traditionally glossed as “longing” or “yearning,” but culturally richer than any single English equivalent. The word belongs to a landscape of loss and belonging, where home is as much an emotional geography as a physical one.

## Related Words

- **saudade** (Portuguese longing; a later companion in your list)
- **fernweh** (yearning for elsewhere; hiraeth’s directional mirror)
- **nostalgia** (longing for the past; adjacent but often softer)
- **homesickness** (the nearest plain term, without the same depth of loss)
