A person's outward manner or bearing, especially as it reveals temperament or self-possession; the visible "tone" of the face and posture. Where *expression* can be momentary, **mien** describes a steadier aura, how someone inhabits themselves.

> *He had the mien of someone who listens before he speaks, as if words were costly and worth weighing.*

## Etymology

From French **mine** “appearance, look,” ultimately from a root meaning “face.” English adopted the word for what the face communicates beyond features: character glimpsed in carriage.

## Related Words

- **demeanor** (behavioral bearing; close in sense)
- **countenance** (face; often with moral or emotional implication)
- **bearing** (posture and presence)
- **air** (the older figurative “look”; lighter and more general)
