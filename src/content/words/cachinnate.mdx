## verb

Laugh loudly and harshly—an unrestrained, ringing laugh with a hint of derision or disbelief (formal, rare). Unlike *chuckle* or *guffaw*, **cachinnate** suggests a sound that fills a room and leaves no space for subtlety.

> *At the boast, someone in the back row cachinnated, and the speaker’s confidence visibly cracked.*

## Etymology

From Latin **cachinnāre** “to laugh loudly,” a verb that seems to mimic its own action: the repeated consonants and open vowels echo the burst-and-roll of uncontrolled laughter. English adopted it as a learned term for laughter too loud to be merely merry.

## Related Words

- **risible** (inclined to laughter; laugh-provoking)
- **guffaw** (a common near-synonym, less bookish)
- **derisive** (often the emotional coloring of cachinnation)
