## noun

Light, mocking banter; teasing that glances off seriousness while still making its point (literary). Unlike *insult*, **persiflage** keeps a smile—critique disguised as play, dismissal dressed as wit.

> *Their persiflage sounded friendly until she noticed how reliably it landed on whatever mattered to her.*

## Etymology

From French **persiflage**, from **persifler** “to mock,” built on **siffler** “to whistle, hiss.” The metaphor is social: mockery as a kind of whistling past, a sound that pretends not to stop.

## Related Words

- **banter** (the benign end of the spectrum)
- **raillery** (teasing, often sharper than banter)
- **satire** (more structured, more moralizing)
- **mordicant** (biting; persiflage’s darker cousin)
