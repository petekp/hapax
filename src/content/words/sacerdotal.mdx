## adjective

Of priests or priesthood; pertaining to sacred rites, clerical authority, or the formal apparatus of worship (formal). Unlike *religious*, which is broad and personal, **sacerdotal** is institutional—holiness organized into office.

> *The ceremony was solemn without being intimate, its sacerdotal grandeur carried on incense and measured chant.*

## Etymology

From Latin **sacerdotalis**, from **sacerdos** “priest,” formed from **sacer** “sacred” and a root meaning “to give.” The word remembers an older idea of priesthood as one who *renders* sacred offerings.

## Related Words

- **clerical** (of clergy; less ritual-heavy)
- **liturgical** (of formal worship; often sacerdotal in style)
- **hieratic** (priestly, formal; more stylistically charged)
- **sacrosanct** (sacred and inviolable; sharing the sacred root)
