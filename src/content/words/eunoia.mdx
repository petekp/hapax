## noun

Beautiful thinking; a gracious, well-disposed mind—goodwill not merely felt, but cultivated as a habit of perception (rare; philosophical). Unlike *kindness*, which can be an act, **eunoia** suggests a stance: the mind’s inclination toward benevolence.

> *Even in argument, her eunoia showed—she spoke as if the other person’s dignity were part of the facts.*

## Etymology

From Greek **eúnoia** “goodwill,” from **eu-** “good” + **noos/nous** “mind.” A small word with a luminous claim: that goodness can be an intellectual style.
