## noun

A heavy, vertically sliding gate, often a gridded lattice of wood and iron, used to secure a castle or fortified entrance. Defense made architectural. A **portcullis** implies siege-thinking: a barrier built to drop fast and mean it.

> *At dusk the portcullis groaned down, and the courtyard became an island of torchlight cut off from the dark fields.*

## Etymology

From Middle French **porte coulisse** "sliding door," from **porte** "door" + **coulisser** "to slide." The word preserves the motion: not swung, but *dropped*, gravity recruited as security.
