The perceived dark gray of complete darkness, the color the eye and brain supply when no light reaches them. A native shade behind closed lids, darkness that feels like a presence, with texture rather than mere absence.

> *In the cabin with the lights out, eigengrau pooled in the corners, softer than black and strangely alive.*

## Etymology

From German **Eigengrau**, literally “own gray” (**eigen** “own” + **grau** “gray”). The coinage is precise and a little eerie: even darkness, it suggests, has a color that belongs to us.

## Related Words

- **afterimage** (a visual residue that can tint darkness)
- **scotopic** (pertaining to low-light vision)
- **tenebrous** (dark, shadowy; more poetic than perceptual)
- **qualia** (the felt “what-it’s-like” of perception; a philosophical kin)
