## adjective

Of the bottom of a sea, lake, or river. Dwelling on, in, or near the substrate. **Benthic** life is shaped by pressure, darkness, and the slow economies of sediment.

> *The diver hovered above the benthic plain, watching starfish move with a patience the surface world never learns.*

## Etymology

From Greek **benthos** "the depths (of the sea)." The scientific adjective maps a vertical world, oriented not by north and south but by surface and floor.
