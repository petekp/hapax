## noun

Programmed cell death: a regulated, energy-dependent process by which a cell dismantles itself in orderly stages, condensing, fragmenting, and being cleared away so the larger organism may live and remain shaped. Where *necrosis* is chaotic death by injury, **apoptosis** is death as design.

> *Under the microscope the cells were not rupturing but bowing out—apoptosis, tidy as autumn leaves falling from a tree.*

## Etymology

From Greek **apóptōsis** "a falling off," from **apo-** "away" + **piptein** "to fall." The modern scientific term was introduced in the 20th century to name a process long observed but newly understood, the body's quiet art of subtraction.

## Related Words

- **necrosis** (unregulated cell death, often inflammatory)
- **caspase** (enzyme family central to apoptotic pathways)
- **autophagy** (cellular self-digestion; related but distinct)
- **homeostasis** (the balancing state apoptosis helps maintain)
