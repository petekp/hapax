Weirdly uncanny, eerie in a way that feels old, inhuman, and slightly wrong. Familiar shapes become suspect when an alien undertone enters them. Something older than fear, and less interested in us.

> *An eldritch glow seeped from the marsh at dusk, and even the birds kept their distance.*

## Etymology

From Scots **eldritch** “strange, eerie,” probably related to an older sense of “other” or “foreign.” The word carries the atmosphere of borderlands—places where the known world thins and the “elsewhere” presses close.

- **chthonian** (of underworld depths; a darker mythic neighbor)
- **weird** (sharing ancestry in fate and strangeness, but broader)
