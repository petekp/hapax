## verb

Foretell or predict, especially by reading signs—weather, symptoms, markets, omens—as if the future left traces in the present (formal). Unlike *guess*, **prognosticate** implies method: prediction with a chart, a calendar, or a practiced eye.

> *The old fisherman could prognosticate a storm from the way gulls argued over an empty sky.*

## Etymology

From Greek **prognōsis** “foreknowledge” (giving English *prognosis*), built from **pro-** “before” + **gnōsis** “knowing.” The word’s dignity comes from its premise: that knowing can reach forward.

## Related Words

- **prognosis** (a forecast, especially medical)
- **augur** (predict by interpreting signs; older and more ritual)
- **presage** (to foreshadow; more atmospheric)
