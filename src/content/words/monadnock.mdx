## noun

An isolated hill or mountain rising abruptly from a surrounding plain, the remnant of more resistant rock after erosion has worn the landscape down. A **monadnock** is defined by its solitude and its story of endurance.

> *The monadnock stood alone in the farmland, a stubborn spine of stone the ages hadn’t managed to level.*

## Etymology

From the name of Mount Monadnock in New Hampshire, itself from an Abenaki (Algonquian) place-name often glossed as “isolated mountain.” Geology turned the proper noun into a common one when it needed a vivid label for a recurring landform: a mountain that remains when the world around it has been planed away.

- **outlier** (geological “left-behind” feature; less precise)
