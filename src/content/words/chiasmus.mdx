A rhetorical crossing in which the order of words or ideas is reversed in parallel phrases, creating a hinge of emphasis and a sense of inevitability (rhetoric). **Chiasmus** turns back on itself, making structure carry meaning.

> *Her sentence snapped shut with chiasmus: “We shape our tools, and then our tools shape us.”*

## Etymology
