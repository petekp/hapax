## noun

A subtle outflow, an exhaled vapor, scent, or intangible emanation. Often used for odors that cling in the air like a memory. Something has come off a body or place and now haunts the space around it.

> *After the rain, an effluvium of wet stone and crushed leaves seeped from the garden walls.*

## Etymology

From Latin **effluvium** “a flowing out,” from **effluere** “to flow out” (**ex-** “out” + **fluere** “to flow”). The word began as a theory of emanations and ended as a perfectly practical way to name what lingers.

## Related Words

- **emanation** (a near-synonym, more abstract in tone)
- **miasma** (a heavier, often noxious atmospheric presence)
- **exhalation** (breath-like outflow; more physiological)
- **effluvia** (the common plural)
