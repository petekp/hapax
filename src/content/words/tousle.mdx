## verb

Ruffle into pleasant disorder. Tangle hair or fabric by handling, wind, or sleep. **Tousle** suggests softness, disarray without damage.

> *The sea breeze tousled his hair until he looked like someone newly forgiven.*

## noun

A ruffled state, especially of hair (less common).

> *She smoothed the tousle only halfway, keeping the day’s wildness as a small crown.*

## Etymology

Probably from Scots or northern English, akin to words meaning “to handle roughly.” Time gentled it: rough handling became a tender kind of rumple.
