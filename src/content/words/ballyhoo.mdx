## noun

A loud, showy fuss of publicity; clamorous promotion that tries to manufacture excitement by sheer volume (informal). **Ballyhoo** is *hype* with a carnival bark in its throat.

> *The ballyhoo arrived weeks before the film did, shouting promises that the story itself could never quite keep.*

## verb

Promote noisily; to tout with sensational exaggeration (informal).

> *They ballyhooed the opening like a miracle, but inside it was simply a well-made room.*

## Etymology

American English, early 20th century, strongly associated with fairground and show-business slang; the precise origin is uncertain, though the sound is half the point—an onomatopoeic flourish meant to be heard across a midway.
