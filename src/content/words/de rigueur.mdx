## adjective

Required by the reigning code of taste, etiquette, or fashion. The obligation here is social, not legal, enforced by approval and embarrassment rather than any written statute. There is often something wry in its use, an acknowledgment that the tribunal is made of eyes.

> *In that circle, understatement was de rigueur; anything earnest had to be disguised as a joke.*

## Etymology

From French **de rigueur** "of strictness," from **rigueur** "strictness, severity." The phrase entered English with its irony intact: a strictness that governs trifles, and trifles that govern lives.

## Related Words

- **mandatory** (the blunt counterpart, without the social nuance)
- **fashionable** (often the effect, though not the compulsion)
- **convention** (the rulebook de rigueur points to)
- **propriety** (the moral-tinged version of the same pressure)
