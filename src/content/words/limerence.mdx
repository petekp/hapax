## noun

An intense, obsessive infatuation characterized by intrusive thoughts, heightened longing for reciprocation, and a tendency to read signs everywhere. Love experienced as fixation and suspense rather than settled attachment (psychological; modern). Not primarily about knowing another person, but about needing an answer.

> *In limerence, every delayed reply felt like a verdict, and every stray kindness looked like proof.*

## Etymology

A modern coinage in psychological writing, formed on a Latinate pattern to name a recognizable state that lacked a widely accepted term. It differentiates a stormy early intensity from the steadier weather of love.

- **infatuation** (closest common near-synonym, less clinically specific)
- **obsession** (a harsher cousin; limerence can feel sweeter)
- **attachment** (what may follow if the feeling matures)
- **erotomania** (a delusional condition; not the same, but sometimes confused)
