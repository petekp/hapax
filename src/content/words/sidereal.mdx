## adjective

Of the stars; measured by the stars rather than the sun—especially of timekeeping that follows Earth’s rotation relative to distant stars (astronomy; technical). Unlike *solar*, which is local and familiar, **sidereal** feels remote: time taken from the deep background.

> *In sidereal time the night seemed to have its own clock, indifferent to human schedules and sunrise.*

## Etymology

From Latin **sidereus** “starry,” from **sidus** “star, constellation.” The word keeps an older plural sense of stars as a patterned company—constellations as the units of the sky.

## Related Words

- **stellar** (of stars; broader and more general)
- **celestial** (of the heavens; less technical)
- **astral** (star-related; often more mystical)
- **ecliptic** (astronomical plane; a different kind of sky-measure)
