## verb

Reproach sharply; scold with moral emphasis, as though lifting a fault into view and holding it there (formal). Unlike *criticize*, which can be analytical, **upbraid** is interpersonal—rebuke with heat.

> *She upbraided him gently, which somehow made the rebuke harder to escape.*

## Etymology

From Old English, with a sense of “bring forth” or “reproach,” braided from roots meaning to “up” and to “brandish” or “suddenly bring.” The word still feels like an act of raising.
