## verb

Grant or concede graciously, often from a position of power. To bestow something as a favor rather than a right. **Vouchsafe** carries hierarchy: the gift colored by condescension or solemnity.

> *He vouchsafed a smile at last, and the room treated it like an award.*

## Etymology

From Middle English, built from **vouch** (from Old French, “to warrant”) + **safe** (“secure”). What is “vouchsafed” is made safe to receive—permission wrapped around generosity.
