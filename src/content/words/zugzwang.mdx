## noun

A situation, especially in chess, in which any move worsens one’s position—action made compulsory and therefore harmful; the burden of having to do *something* (technical; also figurative). Unlike a simple *dilemma*, **zugzwang** is asymmetric: the problem is not choice, but forced motion.

> *Negotiations reached zugzwang; every concession weakened them, yet waiting looked like defeat.*

## Etymology

From German **Zug** “move, pull” + **Zwang** “compulsion.” A crisp compound for a cruel condition: obligation as trap.

## Related Words

- **stalemate** (no legal moves; adjacent but different)
- **impasse** (blocked progress; not necessarily move-forced)
- **Pyrrhic** (victory that damages the victor; kin in consequence)
- **antinomy** (a conflict of principles; a philosophical cousin)
