## noun

A conflict between principles that each appear valid within their own logic, especially a contradiction between laws, duties, or rational conclusions that cannot easily be reconciled. Where *paradox* can be a clever twist, **antinomy** points to a genuine collision of norms.

> *The case exposed an antinomy at the heart of the law: mercy demanded one thing, precedent another.*

## Etymology

From Greek **antinomia** "conflict of laws," from **anti-** "against" + **nomos** "law." The term gained special philosophical resonance in discussions of reason's self-contradictions, but its core image remains juridical: two statutes, both binding, pulling in opposite directions.

## Related Words

- **paradox** (seeming contradiction, often resolvable by insight)
- **dialectic** (the method of working through opposing claims)
- **aporia** (an impasse of reasoning, often productive rather than merely stuck)
- **contradiction** (the plain fact; less diagnostic, less nuanced)
