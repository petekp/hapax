## noun

A rhetorical figure in which an absent, dead, or inanimate entity is given a speaking voice; personhood bestowed for the sake of vivid address (rhetoric). Unlike simple *personification*, **prosopopoeia** is vocal: it does not merely animate—it makes the thing speak.

> *In prosopopoeia the city testified, its bridges and alleys speaking as witnesses the court could not dismiss.*

## Etymology

From Greek **prosōpopoiia**, “the making of a face/person,” from **prosōpon** “face, person” + **poiein** “to make.” A mask becomes a mouth; literature turns absence into presence by giving it a tongue.

## Related Words

- **personification** (the broader animation of the nonhuman)
- **apostrophe** (address to the absent; often paired in effect)
- **ethopoeia** (invented speech fitted to a character; neighboring term)
- **dramatic monologue** (a form that can house prosopopoeia)
