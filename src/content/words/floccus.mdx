## noun

1. A small tuft of wool, down, or soft fiber; a wisp-like shred (rare).

2. In anatomy, a small, tufted structure—especially one resembling a little tassel or clump (technical).

## Etymology

From Latin **floccus** “tuft of wool.” English has kept the word for occasions when “tuft” feels too blunt and one wants the Latin’s airy delicacy.
