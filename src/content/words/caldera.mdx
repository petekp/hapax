## noun

A large volcanic basin formed when a volcano’s summit collapses after an eruption drains the underlying chamber; a crater not of impact but of subsidence (geology). Unlike a simple *crater*, a **caldera** is absence with a history: a hollow left by a vanished mountain.

> *From the rim you could read the eruption’s memory in the caldera’s vastness—an empty place shaped by violence.*

## Etymology

From Spanish **caldera** “cauldron,” from Latin **caldāria** “hot-water boiler.” The metaphor is domestic but apt: the earth, too, keeps its boiling vessels.

## Related Words

- **crater** (the broader category; not always collapsive)
- **magma chamber** (the hidden architecture whose change can create a caldera)
- **stratovolcano** (a common source of large calderas)
- **fumarole** (a surface sign of heat that may linger around calderas)
