Express exuberant pride or delight, especially in someone else's achievements; beam with pleased admiration (informal; from Yiddish). Where *boast* centers the self, **kvell** centers affection. Pride as overflow.

> *She couldn’t help but kvell when her nephew stepped onstage, taller than fear and smiling into the lights.*

## Etymology

From Yiddish **kveln** “to swell (with emotion),” a verb that makes pride physical. English borrowed it with its warmth intact: joy rising until it shows on the face.

- **exult** (rejoice; more formal, less familial)
- **brag** (self-centered pride; what kvelling is not)
