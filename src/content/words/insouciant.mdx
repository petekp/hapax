## adjective

Casually unconcerned; marked by an easy nonchalance that can read as charm, indifference, or quiet defiance (often slightly French in flavor). Where *carefree* is innocent, **insouciant** can be cultivated, a refusal to be pressed.

> *He answered the accusation with an insouciant shrug, as if consequences were a rumor that couldn’t reach him.*

## Etymology

From French **insouciant** “unconcerned,” from **in-** “not” + **souci** “care, worry.” The word’s elegance is part of its meaning: unconcern worn lightly.
