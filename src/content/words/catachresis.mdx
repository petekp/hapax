A strained or "misused" figure of speech, often a metaphor that grabs the wrong handle, creating an image that is vivid, unsettling, or technically improper (rhetoric). **Catachresis** flaunts its misfit. It works by not quite working.

> *He spoke of “the teeth of the horizon,” and the catachresis made the sunset feel suddenly predatory.*

## Etymology

From Greek **katáchrēsis** “misuse,” from **kata-** “against” + **chrēsthai** “to use.” Rhetoricians named it a fault; poets discovered it can also be a weapon.

## Related Words

- **metaphor** (the broader category catachresis distorts)
- **malapropism** (misuse by error, not by rhetorical force)
- **zeugma** (another figure that can feel “wrong” in a productive way)
- **tropology** (the study of figurative turns)
