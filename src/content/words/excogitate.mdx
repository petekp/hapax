## verb

Think out with care, devise by deliberate mental effort. Ideas produced not by spark but by sustained turning-over. Work done in the mind's workshop, gears engaged.

> *She excogitated a solution on the train, staring out at winter fields as if they were diagrams.*

## Etymology

From Latin **excogitāre** “to think out,” from **ex-** “out” + **cogitāre** “to think.” The prefix matters: thought drawn forth, extracted from the raw.

## Related Words

- **cogitate** (to think; less emphatically “worked out”)
- **devise** (to plan or invent; more common)
- **ruminate** (to turn over in the mind; slower, sometimes circular)
- **contrive** (to devise, often with a hint of artifice)
