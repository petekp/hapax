Shining forth brilliantly, radiant with a clear, spreading brightness. Light here implies overflow, issuing outward as if it cannot be contained.

> *The mountains were effulgent at sunrise, their snowfields lit as though from within.*

## Etymology

From Latin **effulgēre** “to shine forth,” from **ex-** “out” + **fulgēre** “to shine.” The word keeps the motion of its origin: brilliance as an outward act.
