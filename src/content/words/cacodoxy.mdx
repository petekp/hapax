Bad doctrine; obstinate belief that has gone wrong, especially in matters where orthodoxy is policed (religious; learned, rare). **Cacodoxy** implies a system of wrongness, an error that teaches itself.

> *He didn’t fear disagreement so much as cacodoxy—the moment a false idea starts sounding like common sense.*

## Etymology

From Greek roots **kako-** “bad” + **doxa** “opinion, belief,” shaped on the model of *orthodoxy*. The word is a diagnostic term: it doesn’t argue; it labels a belief as diseased.

## Related Words

- **orthodoxy** (the “right belief” against which cacodoxy is defined)
- **heterodoxy** (deviation from accepted doctrine, not necessarily “bad”)
- **heresy** (doctrinal error with the heat of condemnation)
- **doxa** (opinion as a philosophical category)
