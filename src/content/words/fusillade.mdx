A rapid, sustained outburst. Originally gunfire, now extended to words, blows, questions, or accusations delivered in quick succession. Where a single *shot* or *remark* is pointed, a **fusillade** overwhelms by quantity and pace.

> *A fusillade of emails arrived before breakfast, each one demanding urgency like a siren.*

## Etymology

From French **fusillade**, from **fusil** “musket,” ultimately from Italian **fucile** “fire-steel.” The term moved from literal firing to metaphorical barrage, keeping the sense of repeated impact.

## Related Words

- **barrage** (a near-synonym with broader military and figurative use)
- **volley** (a coordinated burst; sometimes more orderly)
- **salvo** (a simultaneous discharge; often more punctuated)
- **diatribe** (verbal attack; more sustained argument than rapid fire)
