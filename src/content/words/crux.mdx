## noun

1. The decisive point of a matter; the knot where understanding must either tighten or come undone. A **crux** is the place everything depends on.

> *The crux of their disagreement wasn’t money but trust—once named, it sat between them like a third person.*

2. A cross, especially as a symbol, or (in scholarly editing) a mark indicating a passage judged corrupt or uncertain (technical; academic).

> *The editor placed a crux in the margin, admitting that the manuscript’s sense had broken here.*

## Etymology

Latin **crux** “cross.” The semantic leap from instrument to argument is old and apt: a cross is where lines meet—and where burdens are borne.
