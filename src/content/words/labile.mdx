> *After the shock, her mood was labile—laughter and tears exchanging places with bewildering speed.*

2. In chemistry and biology, prone to rapid transformation or decomposition under given conditions (technical).

> *The solution was too labile to store; by morning it had already become something else.*

## Etymology
