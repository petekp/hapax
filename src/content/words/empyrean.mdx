## noun

The highest heaven; the pure realm of fire or light imagined beyond the sky’s blue, dwelling-place of the divine in medieval and Renaissance cosmology (literary; historical). Unlike *sky*, which is visible, the **empyrean** is an upper world of mind and myth.

> *After the storm, the air cleared so completely the stars looked pinned to the empyrean itself.*

## adjective

Heavenly; pertaining to that highest, radiant realm.

> *An empyrean hush settled over the chapel, as if sound had learned reverence.*

## Etymology

From Medieval Latin **empyreus**, from Greek **empyrios** “in fire,” from **en-** “in” + **pyr** “fire.” The word preserves a cosmos built of elements and ascent: heaven not as distance, but as brightness intensified.

- **ether** (the supposed upper air; a neighboring old science)
- **celestial** (of the heavens; broader and more modern)
