## noun

A swastika-like cross with arms bent at right angles, used historically as a decorative or symbolic motif in European contexts (heraldry; archaeology). In modern English it is often chosen when one wishes to name the form while distancing it from its 20th-century political appropriation (technical; sensitive historical register).

> *In the church floor the fylfot appeared among other medieval tiles—ornament that history would later darken with borrowed meaning.*

## Etymology

A Middle English term of uncertain origin, long used in heraldic and antiquarian description. The word’s survival reflects a need for precision: to distinguish the ancient geometric figure—found across many cultures and centuries—from the narrower, later meanings imposed upon it.

## Related Words

- **swastika** (the more common name; broader cultural range, but heavily politicized)
- **gammadion** (another term for a swastika-shaped figure, built from Greek gamma)

- **meander** (related family of geometric ornament, though not identical)
