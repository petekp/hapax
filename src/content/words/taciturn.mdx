## adjective

Habitually silent and sparing in speech, often from temperament rather than mere circumstance. A **taciturn** person has a guarded interior, speech withheld rather than simply minimized.

> *He was taciturn at parties, smiling as if conversation were a language he understood but didn’t need.*

## Etymology

From Latin **taciturnus**, from **tacere** “to be silent.” A small verb becomes a character trait.
