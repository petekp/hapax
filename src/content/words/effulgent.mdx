## adjective

Shining forth brilliantly; radiant with a clear, spreading brightness (literary). Unlike *bright*, which can be merely strong, **effulgent** implies overflow—light issuing outward as if it cannot be contained.

> *The mountains were effulgent at sunrise, their snowfields lit as though from within.*

## Etymology

From Latin **effulgēre** “to shine forth,” from **ex-** “out” + **fulgēre** “to shine.” The word keeps the motion of its origin: brilliance as an outward act.

## Related Words

- **radiant** (shining; often warmer, more human in feel)
- **resplendent** (splendidly bright; more ornate, more courtly)
- **luminous** (light-giving or light-filled; calmer)
- **coruscate** (to flash and glitter; more flickering than steady)
