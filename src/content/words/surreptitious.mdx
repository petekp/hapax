## adjective

Done by stealth; obtained or carried out in a way meant to escape notice, often because it would not bear the light (formal). Unlike *secret*, which can be neutral, **surreptitious** suggests concealment as method—hiding built into the act.

> *He took a surreptitious glance at the letter, then folded his face back into innocence.*

## Etymology

From Latin **surrepticius** “stolen, secret,” from **surripere** “to snatch away” (**sub-** “from under” + **rapere** “to seize”). The word remembers theft in its bones.

- **covert** (concealed, sometimes officially)
- **sneaky** (informal, blunter)
