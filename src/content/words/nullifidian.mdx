## noun

A person of no faith; one who believes nothing in matters of religion or revelation (rare; often polemical in older use). Unlike *agnostic*, which can be epistemic and cautious, **nullifidian** is categorical: faith counted as zero.

> *In their pamphlets he was branded a nullifidian, as though doubt were a crime and disbelief a contagion.*

## adjective

Having no faith; unbelieving (rare).

> *His nullifidian answers shocked the rector less than their calmness did.*

## Etymology

From Latin **nullus** “none” + **fides** “faith.” A word built like an accusation, with arithmetic in its bones: none, nothing, nil.

## Related Words

- **infidel** (older label for unbeliever; often hostile)
- **atheist** (denial of deity; more specific)
- **skeptic** (doubter; broader and often philosophical)
- **fiduciary** (from the same faith-root, in a secular key)
