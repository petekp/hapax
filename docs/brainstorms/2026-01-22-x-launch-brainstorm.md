# Hapax X Launch Brainstorm

**Date:** 2026-01-22

## What We're Building

A single high-impact launch post on X to introduce Hapax to the design and indie maker communities.

**Goal:** Build an audience interested in the project and the vision behind it.

**Target audience:** Design community, indie web/makers.

## The Launch

### Format

- Single post with animated GIF + short thread (2-3 replies)
- Link in main post

### Main Post

> Hapax — a gallery of rare words, each with its own font and color palette.
>
> Built over the past few months with Claude as my collaborator.
>
> [GIF]
>
> hapax.world

### Thread

**Reply 1 (The collaboration story):**

> Built this with Claude Code over the past few months. It handled the tedious parts—generating color palettes, suggesting fonts, drafting definitions—while I made the calls on what felt right.
>
> A useful division of labor.

**Reply 2 (The vision):**

> I'd like to see more websites like this—small, specific, a little weird. Rabbit holes that exist because someone thought they'd be fun to make.
>
> AI lowers the activation energy for that kind of thing.

**Reply 3 (Optional):**

> Open source: github.com/petekp/hapax

### Visual (Animated GIF)

**Sequence (8-12 seconds):**

1. Gallery view — scroll through words showing variety of fonts and colors (3-4 sec)
2. Click a word — transition animation into detail page (2-3 sec)
3. Detail page — pause on definition with full visual treatment (2-3 sec)
4. Optional: toggle light/dark mode to show color system adapting (2-3 sec)

**Capture tips:**

- Clean browser window (no bookmarks bar)
- Pick visually distinct words for the scroll
- Record at 2x speed, slow down in editing
- Export as MP4 (sharper than GIF on X)

**Tools:** QuickTime/CleanShot X/Kap for recording, Gifski or ezgif.com for conversion

## Why This Approach

- Single launch moment concentrates energy into one push
- Animated GIF captures the visual identity better than static images
- Straightforward copy matches Pete's voice—no hype
- Thread adds context without overwhelming
- Naming Claude specifically adds credibility and ties into the vision
- The "indie web rabbit holes" angle resonates with maker community

## Key Decisions

- **Approach:** Single launch moment over build-up series or soft launch
- **Format:** Animated GIF showing multiple moments
- **Copy angle:** Human-AI collaboration story + vision for indie web
- **Tone:** Grounded and understated, not effusive
- **AI mention:** Name Claude specifically

## Open Questions

- Timing: Which day/time to post for best engagement?
- Should the GIF include sound/music or stay silent?
- Pin the post after launch?
