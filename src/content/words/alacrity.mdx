Brisk, cheerful readiness: the swiftness of someone who *wants* to act, not merely someone who moves quickly. **Alacrity** is speed warmed by willingness.

> *He accepted the hard task with alacrity, as if relief had been hidden inside the work itself.*

## Etymology

From Latin **alacritas** "eagerness, liveliness," from **alacer** "brisk, spirited." English has kept the word's bright edge. It does not just hurry; it leaps.

- **promptitude** (readiness, sometimes more neutral in feeling)
- **celerity** (speed without the implication of gladness)
- **eagerness** (the motive force beneath the motion)
