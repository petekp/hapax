## noun

A pause or break within a line of verse, often marked by syntax or sense rather than punctuation, where the poem inhales, pivots, or lets meaning echo (prosody). The **caesura** is an interior seam, the line cut and stitched while still remaining one.

> *The caesura landed like a held breath, and the second half of the line returned altered by silence.*

## Etymology

From Latin **caesūra** “a cutting,” from **caedere** “to cut.” The term is exact: the poet cuts the line, not to shorten it, but to give it articulation.

## Related Words

- **enjambment** (sense running past the line break; caesura’s frequent counterpoint)
- **meter** (the patterned measure that caesura interrupts or reinforces)
- **hemistich** (half-line; what a strong caesura can seem to create)
- **prosody** (the study of rhythm and sound in verse)
