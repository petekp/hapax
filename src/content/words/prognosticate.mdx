Foretell or predict, especially by reading signs. Weather, symptoms, markets, omens. As if the future left traces in the present. **Prognosticate** implies method: prediction with a chart, a calendar, or a practiced eye.

## Etymology

From Greek **prognōsis** "foreknowledge" (giving English *prognosis*), built from **pro-** "before" + **gnōsis** "knowing." The dignity of it comes from its premise: that knowing can reach forward.
