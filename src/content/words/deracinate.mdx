## verb

Uproot completely, tear out by the roots. The uprooting can be literal, from soil, or figurative, from a culture, language, or sense of belonging. What matters is the severance: the loss is not of location but of rootedness itself.

> *War deracinated the village, scattering families who carried their customs like seedlings in their pockets.*

## Etymology

From Latin **dērācināre**, from **de-** “down, away” + **rādīx** “root.” The word keeps the violence of the action: not transplanting, but wrenching.

## Related Words

- **uproot** (the plain English equivalent)
- **eradicate** (to remove completely; often ideas rather than people)
- **diaspora** (the condition that can follow deracination)
- **rootless** (the resulting state, often with emotional charge)
