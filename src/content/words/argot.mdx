## noun

The private vocabulary and idiom of a particular group, often occupational, criminal, or subcultural. It is used to signal belonging, conceal meaning, or sharpen experience into insider terms. Where *jargon* can be merely technical, **argot** has the tang of the unofficial and the in-group.

> *In the argot of the kitchen, “fire” meant hurry, “dead” meant done, and everyone understood without looking up.*

## Etymology

Borrowed from French **argot**, originally applied to the speech of thieves and beggars and later generalized. Its ultimate origin is uncertain, which suits the word: a term for language that keeps its sources deliberately obscure.

## Related Words

- **cant** (especially the jargon of beggars or thieves; older English term)
- **slang** (informal vocabulary, less bounded by a specific group)
- **jargon** (technical or professional language; often less secretive)
- **patois** (regional speech; sometimes misused as a synonym for argot)
