## noun

A small trinket or decorative knickknack, often of sentimental or kitschy value. An object kept less for use than for the story it quietly claims. Modest, sometimes ridiculous, and beloved anyway.

> *Her shelf was a museum of tchotchkes—souvenirs, tiny animals, a snow globe that remembered every trip.*

## Etymology

From Yiddish **tshatshke**, ultimately from Slavic sources meaning “toy” or “trifle.” English borrowed the sound along with the affectionate eye-roll.
