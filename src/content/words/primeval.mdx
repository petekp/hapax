## adjective

Of the earliest age; belonging to beginnings so old they feel more like origin than history. **Primeval** carries firstness, something untouched by later arrangement.

> *They walked into primeval forest where the air smelled of time before roads.*

## Etymology

From Latin **primaevus** "of the first age," from **primus** "first" + **aevum** "age." A timeline compressed to a threshold: not oldness in general, but the world's early chapter.

## Related Words

- **primevalism** (the aesthetic of “first-world” wildness)
- **archaic** (old-fashioned; more cultural than temporal)
- **pristine** (untouched; a frequent implication)
