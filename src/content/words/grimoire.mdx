## noun

A book of magic. A manual of spells, invocations, and occult procedures, often imagined as dangerous, secretive, and thick with marginalia and smoke. Where a *spellbook* can sound playful, a **grimoire** carries the weight of forbidden method, magic as studied craft.

> *He found the grimoire wrapped in oilcloth, its pages smelling faintly of ash, as if it had been read beside a candle that knew too much.*

## Etymology

From French **grimoire**, originally “grammar book” in medieval usage—a reminder that Latin learning itself once looked like sorcery to the unlettered. Over time the word drifted from rules of language to rules of enchantment: the mysterious book becoming *the* mysterious book.
