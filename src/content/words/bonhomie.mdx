## noun

Genial good humor. An easy, unforced friendliness that puts others at ease without asking anything in return. **Bonhomie** is warmth without performance, conversation that feels like a shared fire.

> *His bonhomie wasn't charm so much as genuine ease, as though the world had already been forgiven.*

## Etymology

Borrowed from French **bonhomie**, from **bon homme** “good man.” The phrase is simple, almost plain, and the quality it names is similarly unpretentious: goodness made sociable.
