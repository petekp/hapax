## noun

The world tree of Norse myth. An immense ash whose roots and branches bind realms together, cosmos imagined as living wood, sustaining gods, humans, and the dead. **Ygdrasil** is architecture: a universe with grain.

> *In the saga’s telling, storms were not weather but whispers in ygdrasil’s leaves.*

## Etymology

A variant spelling of the mythic name more commonly rendered **Yggdrasil**, Old Norse in origin; often interpreted as “Yggr’s (Odin’s) steed,” a kenning suggesting a cosmic support or gallows-tree. The name itself is part riddle, part map.
