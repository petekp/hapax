Glowing after exposure to light; emitting stored energy slowly, so brightness persists in darkness. **Phosphorescent** light lingers where fluorescence fades the moment its source stops. Afterglow as phenomenon.

> *The phosphorescent paint held the day in reserve, and the hallway stayed faintly starred long after the lamps went out.*

## Etymology

From **phosphor-** "light-bearer" (ultimately Greek **phōs** "light" + **pherein** "to carry") + **-escent** "becoming." Myth and measurement married: light carried, then released.
