## noun

A worldview: the underlying scheme of assumptions—moral, metaphysical, political, aesthetic—through which a person or culture interprets reality (philosophical; often Germanic in flavor). Unlike an *opinion*, a **weltanschauung** is structural: it decides what counts as evidence before evidence arrives.

> *They argued policy, but their weltanschauungen were doing the real fighting beneath the words.*

## Etymology

From German **Welt** “world” + **Anschauung** “viewing; perception.” The compound implies not just “view” but “way of seeing.”

## Related Words

- **ideology** (system of beliefs; often more political)
- **ethos** (characteristic spirit; partial overlap)
- **noetic** (of the mind; the instrument that forms a worldview)
- **paradigm** (a governing model; often in science)
