## noun

Ignorance, especially considered as a state with consequences—what one does not know, and perhaps ought to (formal; legal). Unlike casual *unawareness*, **nescience** suggests a deficit that matters: knowledge missing where judgment is required.

> *His nescience wasn’t innocence; it was the kind of not-knowing that comes from never bothering to look.*

## Etymology

From Latin **nescientia** “ignorance,” from **nescire** “not to know.” The word carries a scholastic clarity: ignorance named as a condition, not an excuse.

## Related Words

- **ignorance** (the common equivalent)
- **incognizance** (lack of knowledge; more legalistic)
- **nescient** (adjectival form)
- **agnosticism** (a principled “not knowing” in certain domains)
