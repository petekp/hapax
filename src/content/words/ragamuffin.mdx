## noun

A person, often a child, who looks cheerfully disheveled or ragged, dressed in tatters, sometimes with an air of spirited mischief. **Ragamuffin** is less about wandering than about visible scruffiness, as if poverty or play has frayed the hems.

> *A ragamuffin of a boy burst from the alley laughing, his pockets spilling marbles like stolen constellations.*

## Etymology

From Middle English, likely from a now-obscure proper name or nickname used for a shabby fellow, later generalized into a type. It has always sounded like its subject: rumpled, lively, impossible to press flat.
