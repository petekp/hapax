The earthy, clean scent released when rain first strikes dry ground. Stone-dust, plant oils, and the promise of cooling air braided into one unmistakable aroma. **Petrichor** is specific to that first wet moment, the world turning new at the surface.

> *Petrichor rose from the sidewalk as the storm broke, and the city smelled briefly like a garden remembering itself.*

## Etymology

Formed from Greek **petra** "stone" + **ichor**, the fluid said to run in the veins of the gods. A modern coinage with myth-minded naming: rain waking earth into a scent worthy of legend.
