Make a short, high-pitched, often involuntary sound, sharp as friction, small as panic. Where *shriek* is full-throated, **squeak** is tight and narrow, the voice reduced to a thin bright line.

> *The hinge squeaked in the quiet house, and the sound felt louder than speech.*

## noun

A brief high sound of this kind; also, a narrow escape or marginal success (informal), as if fortune itself rubbed past.

> *They won by a squeak, and the celebration had the tremble of relief.*

## Etymology

Imitative in origin: a word shaped to resemble what it names, with the consonants doing the rubbing.
