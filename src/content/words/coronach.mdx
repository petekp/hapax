## noun

A lament for the dead in Gaelic tradition, a keen or funeral cry, communal and piercing, where grief is given rhythm so it can be carried (historical; cultural). A **coronach** is made to be heard, grief voiced into air.

> *When the coffin crossed the threshold, the coronach rose—no melody, only mourning shaped into sound.*

## Etymology

From Scottish Gaelic **coranach** (also associated with Irish forms), a term for a funeral dirge or wail. The word is onomatopoetic in spirit: a naming that seems to echo the cry it denotes, preserving a rite whose power was as much sonic as symbolic.
