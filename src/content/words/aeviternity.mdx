## noun

In scholastic theology, a mode of duration with a beginning but no end. It is neither time (which measures change) nor eternity (which transcends change), but a third register attributed to angels and the blessed. **Aeviternity** names an endlessness that still remembers an origin.

> *He tried to imagine heaven not as a frozen instant but as aeviternity—unending, yet not outside all sequence.*

## Etymology

From Medieval Latin **aeviternitas**, built on Latin **aevum** “age, aeon” (a long span, but not the absolute) and modeled against **aeternitas** “eternity.” The term belongs to the fine-grained metaphysics of time in the Middle Ages, where even the infinite had to be carefully qualified.
