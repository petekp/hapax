## noun

A long, narrow sea inlet bordered by steep cliffs, typically carved by glaciers and flooded by the sea. Water threaded deep into land like a cold, shining seam. Where a *bay* is general geography, a **fjord** is sculptural: depth, steepness, and glacial history written in the shoreline.

> *The ferry moved through the fjord as if through a corridor, mountains standing close enough to touch the sky.*

## Etymology

From Norwegian **fjord**, from Old Norse **fjǫrðr** “inlet, passage.” The word carries the geography that coined it—coasts where glaciers once did the carving and the sea moved in to occupy the shape.
