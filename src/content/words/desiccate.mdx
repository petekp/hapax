## verb

Dry thoroughly, removing moisture until what remains is shrunken, brittle, or preserved. The drying here is complete, water drawn out as if by design, leaving only the essential structure behind.

> *The desert wind desiccated the clay bowls overnight, leaving them light enough to ring when tapped.*

## Etymology

From Latin **desiccare** “to dry up,” from **de-** (intensifying) + **siccus** “dry.” The Latin root is austere, and so is the result.
