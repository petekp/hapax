## noun

A listless dissatisfaction; boredom with a faint taste of melancholy, as if the world has gone thin and effort no longer pays (often literary). Unlike simple *boredom*, **ennui** suggests fatigue of the soul, not merely a lack of entertainment.

> *Travel didn’t cure his ennui; it only gave it more scenery.*

## Etymology

Borrowed from French **ennui** “boredom, vexation,” from Old French **enoi** “annoyance,” related to a sense of being troubled or burdened. The word’s elegance is deceptive: its roots are not languid but irritated.
