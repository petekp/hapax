## noun

A leaden spiritual weariness. More than mere laziness, acedia is a sour, restless aversion to one's duties, one's place, even one's own life. It feels like fatigue that will not rest and boredom that will not lift. Where *ennui* remains secular, **acedia** has a moral and devotional sting: indifference as temptation.

> *At noon the monastery seemed to hold its breath, and acedia crept in like heat through stone.*

## Etymology

From Greek **akēdía** "lack of care," from **a-** "not" + **kēdos** "care, concern." Early Christian ascetics wrote of it as the "noonday demon," the hour when prayer curdles into irritation and the mind hunts for escape. Later moral theology folded it into the genealogy of *sloth*, but the older word preserves the texture of the experience, a listlessness that feels like betrayal.

## Related Words

- **sloth** (later moral category that overlaps but does not exhaust the idea)
- **melancholia** (older medical-moral neighbor with a darker gravity)
- **lassitude** (physical languor without the spiritual register)
- **ennui** (modern cousin, more secular in flavor)
