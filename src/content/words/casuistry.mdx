## noun

1. The careful reasoning of moral cases, weighing duties and circumstances where rules collide—an attempt to make conscience practical (ethics; historical). At its best, **casuistry** is precision applied to lived complexity.

> *Their debate was casuistry in the old sense: not evasion, but an honest struggle to do right in crooked conditions.*

2. Sophistical or overly subtle reasoning used to justify what one already wants to do (often pejorative).

> *He called it principle, but everyone heard the casuistry—logic bent into a convenient shape.*

## Etymology

From Latin **casus** “case,” via **casuist** and learned moral theology. The word’s double reputation comes from its double possibility: nuance can illuminate, or it can excuse.
