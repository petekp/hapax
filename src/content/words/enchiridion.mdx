## noun

A handbook kept close at hand, a compact manual of guidance, precept, or method. It is meant less to impress than to be used, wisdom portable enough to consult in the moment of need.

> *She carried a small enchiridion of poems, opening it like a lantern whenever the day grew narrow.*

## Etymology

From Greek **encheiridion** “that which is in the hand,” from **en** “in” + **cheir** “hand.” The word’s literal meaning is its philosophy: knowledge as something you can hold, not merely admire.

- **manual** (the plain descendant of the same impulse)
- **compendium** (a condensed collection; less explicitly handy)
