## verb

Soil by smearing; stain with grime—or, more often, tarnish a reputation by attaching some sticky insinuation to it. Unlike *criticize*, **besmirch** implies defilement: the harm is not in argument but in the smear itself.

> *A single rumor besmirched his name more efficiently than any proven fault could have done.*

## Etymology

Formed with the intensifying prefix **be-** + **smirch** “a smudge, a stain,” a word of Germanic stock. The sound of **smirch** is already dirty; **be-** only spreads it further.

## Related Words

- **sully** (to stain, especially morally)
- **tarnish** (to dull luster; often reputational)
- **defame** (legal and direct; less tactile)
- **smear** (the blunt modern verb; lacking the older texture)
