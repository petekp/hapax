## noun

The felt “what-it’s-like” of experience: the redness of red, the sting of salt, the ache of nostalgia—subjective texture as it is lived from inside (philosophical; technical). Unlike *sensation*, which can be treated as data, **qualia** insists on privacy: experience as irreducibly personal.

> *He could describe the wavelength, but not the qualia—the particular red that made the memory hurt.*

## Etymology

From Latin **quale** “of what kind,” pluralized in modern philosophy to name qualities of consciousness that resist reduction to measurement. The term is spare on purpose: a small word for a stubborn remainder.

## Related Words

- **consciousness** (the domain in which qualia appear)
- **phenomenology** (the study of experience as lived)
- **noumenon** (the “thing-in-itself”; often contrasted in discussions of knowability)
- **pareidolia** (a perception phenomenon where experience outruns stimulus)
