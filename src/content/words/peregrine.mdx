## adjective

1. Wandering; foreign or coming from abroad. **Peregrine** suggests travel and displacement, otherness earned by distance.

> *He spoke with a peregrine ease, as if his life had been made in stations and border towns.*

2. Of a falcon species (*Falco peregrinus*) famed for swift flight and long-ranging habit (zoological).

> *A peregrine stooped from the cliff, the dive so fast it seemed like a tear in the air.*

## noun

A peregrine falcon.

> *The peregrine returned each spring, claiming the same ledge as if the mountain were a calendar.*

## Etymology

From Latin **peregrinus** “foreign; traveling,” from **per** “through” + **ager** “field, land.” The root image is movement across land—an etymology that suits both the traveler and the far-flying bird.
