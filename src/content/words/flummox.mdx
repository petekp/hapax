## verb

To thoroughly confuse, to thwart by bewilderment, leaving someone momentarily without a next move. Where *puzzle* can be gentle or even pleasant, **flummox** implies being knocked sideways by confusion.

> *The question flummoxed him not because it was hard, but because it exposed what he'd never bothered to define.*

## Etymology

Probably from dialect or slang in 19th-century English; its ultimate origin is uncertain. The word’s expressive bulk does much of its meaning: it sounds like being hit with a soft, unexpected object.
