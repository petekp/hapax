## noun

A workshop devoted to art or craft, especially a painter's studio or a fashion house's working rooms. Here skill is practiced, materials are tested, and style is made by hand and habit. **Atelier** suggests not merely a room but a discipline: work done among tools, apprentices, and light.

> *In the atelier, garments were not “designed” so much as argued into being—pins, chalk, and silence doing the persuading.*

## Etymology

From French **atelier** "workshop," once used broadly of a place where artisans labored. In English it retained the French aura of craft elevated to art, the room where talent becomes method.
