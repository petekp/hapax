## noun

A character type—especially in Japanese popular culture—who presents as prickly, cold, or combative, yet later reveals a softer, affectionate core; tenderness armored as hostility (cultural; contemporary). Unlike simple *shyness*, **tsundere** is performative defense: love expressed first as refusal.

> *Her tsundere devotion showed in the details—bandages left on the table, insults used as curtains.*

## Etymology

From Japanese **ツンデレ (tsundere)**, blending **tsuntsun** (“to turn away in disgust; be aloof”) and **deredere** (“lovestruck; sweetly affectionate”). The word is a miniature arc: bristle, then melt.

## Related Words

- **kōhai** (junior; often a dynamic in such narratives)
- **dere** (the affectionate half of the blend)
- **archetype** (the literary container for the trope)
- **insouciant** (surface coolness; different emotional engine)
