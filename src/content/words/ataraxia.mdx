## noun

A calm beyond perturbation: the settled, lucid untroubledness prized in Epicurean and skeptical philosophy, where desire is disciplined and fear—especially fear of death—is disarmed (philosophical). **Ataraxia** is not numbness; it is serenity earned.

> *After the letter arrived, she felt not joy but ataraxia—the quiet of a mind that no longer argued with what was.*

## Etymology

From Greek **ataraxía** “untroubledness,” from **a-** “not” + **tarassein** “to disturb, trouble.” The word’s negative prefix is not a void but a method: remove the agitation, and clarity remains.

## Related Words

- **equanimity** (even-mindedness; a modern ethical kin)
- **apatheia** (Stoic freedom from passions; adjacent but not identical)
- **tranquillity** (calmness, less philosophically specific)
- **serenity** (the felt surface of ataraxia)
