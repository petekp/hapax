## noun

A sudden reversal of circumstances, especially in drama. The turn where what seemed secure collapses or what seemed lost is abruptly reclaimed. **Peripeteia** is structural, changing the story's direction by changing its stakes.

> *The peripeteia came quietly: a letter opened, a name recognized, and the whole future rerouted.*

## Etymology

From Greek **peripeteia** "reversal," from **peri-** "around" + a verb meaning "to turn, to fall." Classical dramatic theory gave it shape, but its reach is everyday: lives, too, have turning points that feel like plot.

## Related Words

- **anagnorisis** (recognition; often paired with peripeteia in tragedy)
- **denouement** (untying of the plot; what follows the turn)
- **catastrophe** (the disastrous outcome a peripeteia can trigger)
