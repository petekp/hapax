## adjective

Supple and gracefully flexible; bending with ease and strength, as a branch bends without breaking, or a body moves without friction (literary; also general). Unlike *thin*, **lithe** is about motion, not measure: agility made visible.

> *The dancer’s lithe spine seemed to write its own music, each movement answering the last with quiet certainty.*

## Etymology

From Old English **līthe** “gentle, mild; pliant,” related to a Germanic family of words for softness and ease. The meaning has narrowed from temperament to body, but the original gentleness still clings to the modern sense.
