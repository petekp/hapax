The body's sense of itself in space. The unconscious awareness of limb position, movement, and balance that lets you touch your nose with eyes closed or walk without watching your feet. **Proprioception** is inward, perception of the self by the self.

> *In the dark she reached for the banister, trusting proprioception to place her hand where memory said wood would be.*

## Etymology

Built from Latin **proprius** "one's own" + **perception**. A name for a subtle faculty long taken for granted: the body not only moved but quietly *known*.

## Related Words

- **kinesthesia** (sense of movement; often overlapping)
- **vestibular** (balance system; a key contributor)
- **sensorimotor** (the loop between sensing and acting)
- **somatic** (of the body; the broader domain)
