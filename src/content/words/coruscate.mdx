## verb

Flash, glitter, or gleam with quick, lively changes of light; sparkle as if light were being struck from within (literary). To **coruscate** implies flicker and pulse, brightness in motion.

> *Sunlight coruscated on the river, a restless brilliance the eye could hardly hold.*

## Etymology

From Latin **coruscare** “to flash, quiver, glitter,” likely imitative of sudden shimmering. English retains the word for light that cannot sit still.
