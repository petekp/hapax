## noun

1. A foul, unhealthy vapor once believed to arise from decay and to cause disease; “bad air” as medical explanation (historical; scientific).

> *The city blamed the fever on miasma from the marshes, as if sickness were simply something you could smell.*

2. A stifling or corrupting atmosphere—literal or figurative—that seems to seep from a place, an era, or a moral condition (literary).

> *A miasma of resentment hung over the meeting, thick enough to taste.*

## Etymology

From Greek **míasma** “pollution, defilement,” from **miainein** “to stain.” The word began as moral contamination and became environmental theory; later science corrected the cause, but the metaphor endured because the feeling is real.
