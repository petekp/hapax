## noun

"World-pain." A melancholy arising from the perceived gap between how the world is and how it ought to be. Sorrow with a philosophical horizon. **Weltschmerz** is interpretive: grief as an opinion about reality.

> *His weltschmerz wasn’t self-pity; it was pity for a world that kept failing its own possibilities.*

## Etymology

From German **Welt** “world” + **Schmerz** “pain.” Popularized in Romantic-era discourse, where sensitivity itself could feel like a wound.
