A rumbling or gurgling in the intestines, especially as audible stomach "growling" produced by moving gas and fluid. *Stomach growl* is domestic and comic. **Borborygmus** names the same sound with clinical clarity and, oddly, with a kind of music.

> *In the hush of the lecture hall, a borborygmus rose from the back row like an ill-timed bassoon.*

## Etymology

From Greek **borborygmos**, an imitative word shaped to the sound it denotes. Rolling consonants and liquid vowels that mimic the body's own acoustics. English keeps the learned spelling, but the ear recognizes the origin immediately.
