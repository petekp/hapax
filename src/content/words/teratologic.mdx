## adjective

Of monsters or monstrosities; pertaining to teratology—the study of congenital anomalies and the forms that culture has called “monstrous” (technical; rare). Unlike *grotesque*, which is aesthetic judgment, **teratologic** is classificatory: the monstrous as category, specimen, or case.

> *The exhibit’s teratologic language tried to sound clinical, but the visitors still whispered.*

## Etymology

From Greek **teras/terat-** “monster, marvel” + **-logia** “study.” The root once meant wonder as much as horror—monsters as signs.
