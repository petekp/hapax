## adjective

1. Remarkably beautiful or finely wrought, possessing a precision that feels almost impossibly exact.

> *The miniature was exquisite—so detailed you could almost hear the painted figures whispering.*

2. Keenly sensitive, especially to pleasure or pain. Finely tuned to slight impressions.

> *After the fever broke, she had an exquisite awareness of light, as if the world had been newly lacquered.*

## noun

A person punctilious in dress or taste, one who cultivates refinement to a conspicuous degree. Often used with a note of irony.

## Etymology

From Latin **exquisitus** “carefully sought out,” past participle of **exquirere** “to search out.” What is exquisite, the word suggests, has been chosen with effort—beauty as selection, not accident.
