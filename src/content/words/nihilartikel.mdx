## noun

A deliberately fictitious entry planted in a reference work—dictionary, encyclopedia, directory—meant to be recognized as false or to function as a copyright trap: “nothing” dressed as knowledge (technical; rare). Unlike an ordinary *error*, a **nihilartikel** is intentional, a decoy with a purpose.

> *The scholar smiled when she met the nihilartikel—an invented biography tucked in among the real ones like a watermark made of words.*

## Etymology

From German **Nihilartikel**, a compound of Latin **nihil** “nothing” and German **Artikel** “article.” The name is bluntly elegant: an “article about nothing,” inserted so that copying can be proved—or so that readers can be tested for attentiveness.
