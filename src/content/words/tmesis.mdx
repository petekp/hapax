The separation of parts of a word by the insertion of other words, often for emphasis or rhythm, as in "abso-bloody-lutely." **Tmesis** is grammatical surgery: the word split but still recognizable.

> *“Un-freaking-believable,” he said—tmesis turning one adjective into a small explosion.*

## Etymology

From Greek **tmēsis** “a cutting,” from **temnein** “to cut.” The term is blunt about its method.

## Related Words

- **infix** (the inserted element, in linguistic terms)
- **expletive infixation** (a common modern form of tmesis)
- **elide** (another figure of removal rather than insertion)
- **zeugma** (a different kind of grammatical strain)
