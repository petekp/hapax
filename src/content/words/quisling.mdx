## noun

A traitor who collaborates with an enemy occupying power, someone who betrays their own side for advantage or ideology. **Quisling** carries the chill of civic treason, betrayal under pressure, when loyalty is most costly.

> *In the small town’s memory, his name became a quisling’s—spoken softly, as if betrayal could still be contagious.*

## Etymology

From the surname of Vidkun Quisling, the Norwegian politician whose collaboration during World War II made his name a byword. A life reduced to a caution.
