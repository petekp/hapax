Of singing: moving through several notes on a single syllable, so that the voice ornaments the word with a ribbon of melody. Where *lyrical* concerns words, **melismatic** concerns how the voice lingers beyond them.

> *On the final “amen,” her melismatic line climbed and turned, making one syllable last long enough to feel like forgiveness.*

## Etymology

From Greek **melisma** “song; melody,” from **melos** “song.” The term entered English through music theory to describe a practice ancient in chant and enduring in many vocal traditions: meaning stretched into music.
