A flamboyant charlatan who sells false cures or promises from a platform of showmanship; a confidence artist with theatrical flair. A **mountebank** depends on spectacle, deception as performance.

> *The mountebank worked the crowd like a conductor, turning doubt into applause and applause into sales.*

## Etymology

From Italian **monta in banco** “mounts the bench,” referring to the raised platform used by street peddlers of remedies. The word preserves the staging: a scam that begins by stepping up where everyone can see.
