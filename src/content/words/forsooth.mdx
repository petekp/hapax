In truth. Indeed. An emphatic or sometimes ironic intensifier, now chiefly in archaic or mock-archaic style. Where plain *indeed* is neutral, **forsooth** carries a faint stage-light: sincerity performed, or sincerity parodied.

> *"Forsooth," he said with a bow, and the room understood at once that he was teasing.*

## Etymology

From Middle English **for sothe** “for truth,” from **for** “for” + **sooth** “truth.” The word preserves **sooth**, once a common noun, inside a fossil phrase that still tastes of old seriousness.

## Related Words

- **sooth** (truth; largely archaic outside set phrases)
- **soothsayer** (truth-speaker; prophetic sense)
- **verily** (another archaic “indeed”)
- **indeed** (modern equivalent)
